    "> A word of caution is necessary: programming is inherently deterministic, and comprises a clear set of instructions, that yield  -- within certain tolerances -- repeatable results.  </p> On the other hand, large language models are probabilistic machines, and depending on such hyper-parameters as the `temperature`, tend to yield different results on eahc invocation. Here, the value of `temperature` controls the output variations, with `temperature=0` producing close to repeatable results (one reason that this setting is often the default in many situations). On the other hand, higher value, say `temperature=0.9` will tend to produce different results each time.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> From our last week's session (our exploration of softmax-temperature), we recall that the temperature is a hyperparameter of the softmax classifier. In other words, when determining the probability of the next word $x_i$ from a vocabulary, the large language models use $$\\mathbf{softmax}(x_i/T) = \\frac{e^{x_i/T}}{\\sum_j e^{x_j/T}}$$ Therefore, the higher the temperature, the more the probability distribution is flattened, and thus a generative model is more likely to sample and pick not necessarily the most likely word, but the next ones in probability. In effect, this leads to a higher variation in the generated text.\n",
