We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.',\n",
       " 'In machine learning, backpropagation(backprop,[1] BP) is a widely usedalgorithm for training feedforwardartificial neural networks.Generalizations of backpropagationexist for other artificial neuralnetworks (ANNs), and for functionsgenerally. These classes of algorithmsare all referred to generically as\"backpropagation\".[2] In fitting aneural network, backpropagationcomputes the gradient of the lossfunction with respect to the weights ofthe network for a single input–outputexample, and does so efficiently,unlike a naive direct computation ofthe gradient with respect to eachweight individually. This efficiencymakes it feasible to use gradientmethods for training multilayernetworks, updating weights to minimizeloss; gradient descent, or variantssuch as stochastic gradient descent,are commonly used. The backpropagationalgorithm works by computing thegradient of the loss function withrespect to each weight by the chainrule, computing the gradient one layerat a time, iterating backward from thelast layer to avoid redundantcalculations of intermediate terms inthe chain rule; this is an example ofdynamic programming.[3]',\n",
