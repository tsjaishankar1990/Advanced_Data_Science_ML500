      "Summary: We address representation learning for large-scale instance-level image\n",
      "retrieval. Apart from backbone, training pipelines and loss functions, popular\n",
      "approaches have focused on different spatial pooling and attention mechanisms,\n",
      "which are at the core of learning a powerful global image representation. There\n",
      "are different forms of attention according to the interaction of elements of\n",
      "the feature tensor (local and global) and the dimensions where it is applied\n",
      "(spatial and channel). Unfortunately, each study addresses only one or two\n",
      "forms of attention and applies it to different problems like classification,\n",
      "detection or retrieval.\n",
      "  We present global-local attention module (GLAM), which is attached at the end\n",
      "of a backbone network and incorporates all four forms of attention: local and\n",
      "global, spatial and channel. We obtain a new feature tensor and, by spatial\n",
      "pooling, we learn a powerful embedding for image retrieval. Focusing on global\n",
      "descriptors, we provide empirical evidence of the interaction of all forms of\n",
      "attention and improve the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\n",

      "Summary: This paper aims to tackle the challenging task of one-shot object counting.\n",
      "Given an image containing novel, previously unseen category objects, the goal\n",
      "of the task is to count all instances in the desired category with only one\n",
      "supporting bounding box example. To this end, we propose a counting model by\n",
      "which you only need to Look At One instance (LaoNet). First, a feature\n",
      "correlation module combines the Self-Attention and Correlative-Attention\n",
      "modules to learn both inner-relations and inter-relations. It enables the\n",
      "network to be robust to the inconsistency of rotations and sizes among\n",
      "different instances. Second, a Scale Aggregation mechanism is designed to help\n",
      "extract features with different scale information. Compared with existing\n",
      "few-shot counting methods, LaoNet achieves state-of-the-art results while\n",

      "Recent work has suggested the possibility that general attention mechanisms\n",
      "used by RNNs could be replaced by active-memory mechanisms. In this work, we\n",
      "evaluate whether various active-memory mechanisms could replace self-attention\n",
      "in a Transformer. Our experiments suggest that active-memory alone achieves\n",
      "comparable results to the self-attention mechanism for language modelling, but\n",
      "optimal results are mostly achieved by using both active-memory and\n",
      "self-attention mechanisms together. We also note that, for some specific\n",
