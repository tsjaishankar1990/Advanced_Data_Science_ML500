The old turnpike\\r\\n\\n\\nroad running through the mountain pass, lonely at the best times, seemed\\r\\n\\n\\nquite deserted now.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old Scotch toll-gate keeper sat shivering over his blazing hickory\\r\\n\\n\\nwood fire, and listening to the dashing rain and beating wind that\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed to threaten the destruction of his rude dwelling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis old wife sat near him, spinning yarn from a small wheel that she\\r\\n\\n\\nturned with the united action of hand and foot.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ugh!” shuddered the old man, as a blast fiercer than ever shook the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse, “it ’ill ding down the old dwelling next, and no harm done! An it\\r\\n\\n\\nwere once blown away, the company would behoove to build us anither\\r\\n\\n\\nstrong enough to stand the storms o’ these parts. Hech! but it’s awfu’\\r\\n\\n\\ncold.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Pit anither log on the fire, gudeman. Wood’s plenty enough, that’s a\\r\\n\\n\\nblessing,” said the old woman, without ceasing to turn her wheel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wha’s the use, Jenny? Ye’ll no warm sic an old place as this. Eh,\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman, but whiles my knees are roasting, my back is freezing.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Aweel, then gae away to bed wid ye, Andy, and I’ll tuck ye up warm, and\\r\\n\\n\\nbring ye your hot toddy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nay, Jenny, worse luck, I maun sit up to let the bridegroom through the\\r\\n\\n\\ngate.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The bridegroom? Hoot, man! He’ll no pass the road on sic a wild night\\r\\n\\n\\nas this.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will he no, and his bonny bride waiting? Jenny, woman, what like o’\\r\\n\\n\\nwind or weather would ha’ stopt me the day we were gaun to be married?\\r\\n\\n\\nSo ye maun gie me my pipe, gudewife, for I bide here to open the gate\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the blithe bridegroom to pass through.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But he maun see that no tender lassie can take the road in sic a storm\\r\\n\\n\\nas this, and they were to be married by special license at nine, and gae\\r\\n\\n\\naway in a grand travelling carriage at ten, to meet the steamboat at\\r\\n\\n\\neleven. But that can no be now, for the rain is comin’ down like Noah’s\\r\\n\\n\\nflood, and the wind blowing a hurricane, to say naething o’ the roads\\r\\n\\n\\nall being turned into rinning rivers,” argued Jenny.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It will be for _her_ to decide whether it can or canna be. It will be\\r\\n\\n\\nfor _him_ to take the road in the worst weather that ever fell from\\r\\n\\n\\nheaven, if it be to keep his tryst with his troth-plighted bride. So gie\\r\\n\\n\\nme my pipe, Jenny, for I’se stop up to let the bridegroom gae by.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He willna come now, and so ye’ll see, gudeman,” said the wife, as she\\r\\n\\n\\nfilled his pipe, and pressed the tobacco well down into the bowl with\\r\\n\\n\\nher big fore finger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“An he does na come through wind or rain or snow, or ony ither like o’\\r\\n\\n\\nweather the Lord please to send this night, and I were Miss Anna Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\nI’d cast him off in the morn like old shoes,” nodded Andy, as he took\\r\\n\\n\\nthe pipe from his wife and put it into his mouth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But don’t ye see, gudeman, that it’ll be nae use. She _canna_ travel on\\r\\n\\n\\nsic a night as this.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’m no that sure she will be called upon to travel the night. I heard a\\r\\n\\n\\nrumor they had changed all that. And there was to be a grand wedding at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old Hall, and a hall and a supper, and that the bonny bride and\\r\\n\\n\\nbridegroom wouldna gae away till the morn. And I’se believe it,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAndy, taking the big tongs, picking up a live coal, and beginning to\\r\\n\\n\\nlight his pipe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hoot, man, that will be no decent. She’ll behoove to marry and gae away\\r\\n\\n\\nlike ither brides, but she’ll no be married and gae away the night. The\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding maun be pit off,” said Jenny, resuming her place at the wheel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Pit off! It hae been pit off twice a’ready, once when the old Judge\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon died, then when the old lady died. An it be pit off a third time,\\r\\n\\n\\nit ’ill never take place. But it will no be put off. He’ll keep his\\r\\n\\n\\ntryst, and she’ll keep her word. Worse luck that I hae to bide up to let\\r\\n\\n\\nhim through.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“An he maun come, pity he could na ha’ come sooner.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hoot, gudewife, how could he? The steamer does na stop at the Stormy\\r\\n\\n\\nPetrel Landing until nigh noon, and it will be a good fifty miles from\\r\\n\\n\\nhere. And he travelling in his ain carriage without a change of horses\\r\\n\\n\\nall the way over sic roads, and in sic weather as this? How will he come\\r\\n\\n\\nsooner?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh! but I wish he were here!” cried the old woman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There he’ll be now!” exclaimed the old man, rising and listening, as in\\r\\n\\n\\na temporary lull of the tempest the sound of carriage wheels was heard\\r\\n\\n\\ndashing, rumbling and tumbling along the road.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Take your big shawl about you,” said Jenny, rising and reaching down a\\r\\n\\n\\nheavy gray “maud” from its peg, and throwing it over Andy’s shoulders,\\r\\n\\n\\nas, with a lighted candle in his hand, he went to open the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hech, sirs! what a night to take the road in! Naething but a waiting\\r\\n\\n\\nbride should fetch a man forth in sic weather!” exclaimed the old\\r\\n\\n\\ntoll-taker, as a blast of wind and rain blew out his candle, and whirled\\r\\n\\n\\nhis shawl up over his head.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Shut the door, gudeman, or we’ll both be drowned in our ain house, and\\r\\n\\n\\nbide a we till I bring ye the lantern. Ye’ll no be able to take a\\r\\n\\n\\nlighted candle out there,” said Jenny, as she ran to a corner cupboard\\r\\n\\n\\nand brought forth an old horn machine big enough for a lighthouse or a\\r\\n\\n\\nwatch tower. She lit the candle end that was in it, and handed it to\\r\\n\\n\\nAndy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe having meanwhile, fastened his great shawl with several strong pins\\r\\n\\n\\nand skewers, once more opened the door, and went forth into the pitch\\r\\n\\n\\ndark night and raging storm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA spacious travelling carriage stood at the toll-gate, with two crimson\\r\\n\\n\\nlamps glowing luridly through the dark, driving tempest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHolding down his hat with one hand and carrying the lantern with the\\r\\n\\n\\nother, old Andy pushed on towards the carriage, and saw that its door\\r\\n\\n\\nstood open, and a young man in a heavy travelling cloak was leaning out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Be gude to us, sir! is it yoursel’, sure enough? Troth, I said ye would\\r\\n\\n\\ncome,” said Andy, with a welcoming smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come! why, to be sure I would come. Did you think that any sort of\\r\\n\\n\\nweather would have stopped me on such an occasion as this? Why, Birney,\\r\\n\\n\\nI would have come if it had rained pitchforks, points downward, or wild\\r\\n\\n\\ncats and mad dogs,” laughed the young man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sae I said, sir; sae I said!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, Birney, my friend, I must get out and stretch my limbs a little. I\\r\\n\\n\\nwant to be able to stand when I get to the Hall; but really, I have been\\r\\n\\n\\ncramped up in this close carriage so many hours, riding over this beast\\r\\n\\n\\nof a country so many miles, without seeing a single place where I could\\r\\n\\n\\nstop for refreshment, that—that—in short, Birney, you must let me out\\r\\n\\n\\nand let me in,” said the traveller.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Surely, Mr. Alexander! surely, sir! and much honor to my humble home,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid the old toll-taker, smiling, and bowing respectfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe young man, notwithstanding his “cramped” condition, leaped lightly\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom his carriage, drew his travelling cloak closely around him, hoisted\\r\\n\\n\\na large umbrella, and unceremoniously preceded his host to the house,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere he burst suddenly in upon Jenny, who was in the act of taking a\\r\\n\\n\\nkettle of boiling water from the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gude save us! Mr. Alick, is it yoursel’? I could hardly believe ony\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman in his sober sinses would take the road on sic a night!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is myself, Mistress Birney—that I know; but as to being in my sober\\r\\n\\n\\nsenses, I am not quite so sure. I see you’ve got some hot water there. I\\r\\n\\n\\nhope you have also got a sample of that fine old Scotch whiskey your\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband used to drink in remembrance of your old country. If so,\\r\\n\\n\\nMistress Birney, I’ll thank you to make me a tumbler of hot toddy. It\\r\\n\\n\\nwould be very acceptable in such weather as this,” said “Mr. Alick,” as\\r\\n\\n\\nhe threw off his cloak and his cap, and dropped himself down into old\\r\\n\\n\\nAndy’s own arm-chair, in the warm chimney corner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Surely, sir! surely, Mr. Alick! I’se make it directly. I’se e’en now\\r\\n\\n\\njust gaun to mix the gude man’s night drink for himsel’,” smiled Jenny,\\r\\n\\n\\nhospitably.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right! mix mine at the same time,” said the young man, stretching\\r\\n\\n\\nout his feet to the fire, and indulging in a great yawn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And mix it in the big stone pitcher with the zinc cover, so it will\\r\\n\\n\\nkeep hot while we sit and drink the bonny bride, Miss Anna Lyon’s\\r\\n\\n\\nhealth,” said old Andy as he came in and closed the door to keep out the\\r\\n\\n\\ndriving rain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, look here! You know I’ve no time for health-drinking; I’m due at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Hall these three hours; only this horrid weather, and these beastly\\r\\n\\n\\nroads have delayed me,” exclaimed Mr. Alick, rising impatiently and\\r\\n\\n\\nstanding before the blazing fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was a very good-looking young fellow, as he stood there. He had a\\r\\n\\n\\ntall, well-proportioned form, fine regular features, a fair, roseate\\r\\n\\n\\ncomplexion, light yellow hair, and bright blue eyes—smiling eyes that\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed to love all they looked upon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nQuickly and skilfully Jenny Birney made the toddy and poured it into\\r\\n\\n\\nlarge tumblers that she had previously heated by scalding them out with\\r\\n\\n\\nboiling water.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOnce more Mr. Alick dropped himself into old Andy’s chair, while he\\r\\n\\n\\nreceived one of the glasses from his host.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh, there sir; it’s as hot as love!” said the old man, as he passed the\\r\\n\\n\\npitcher that his guest might replenish his glass at his pleasure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is very good,” admitted the young man when he had finished his\\r\\n\\n\\nsecond tumbler. “Many thanks to you, Mistress Birney for the aid and\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfort you have given me. I feel as if you had saved my life. I can now\\r\\n\\n\\ndo the distance between this and the Hall without breaking down. And now\\r\\n\\n\\nI must be off. Good evening to you, Mistress Birney.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the traveller put on his cloak and cap, took up his umbrella, and\\r\\n\\n\\nescorted by Andy, left the cottage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, by the way, Birney, you may bring out some of that hot stuff to my\\r\\n\\n\\ncoachman. Poor devil! it will do him no harm after he has been perched\\r\\n\\n\\nup there so long in the rain. But hark ye, Birney! don’t let it be too\\r\\n\\n\\nstiff; I don’t want the fellow to see more mists before his eyes than\\r\\n\\n\\nthe night and the storm make,” said Mr. Alick as he got into the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Andy toddled back to his house, and after a few minutes reappeared\\r\\n\\n\\nat the carriage with a mug of the same restorative for the man as he had\\r\\n\\n\\nlately administered to the master.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe chilled and wearied coachman turned it down his throat almost at a\\r\\n\\n\\ngulp, returned the mug, and thanked the donor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he gathered up his reins, cracked his whip, and started his horses\\r\\n\\n\\nat as brisk a trot as might be deemed safe on that dark night over that\\r\\n\\n\\nrough road.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old turnpike-keeper hurried out of the storm into the shelter of his\\r\\n\\n\\nown cottage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hech! it’s an awfu’ night! I’m glad he’s come and gone. We may pit up\\r\\n\\n\\nthe shutters now, gudewife; we’ll no be troubled wi’ ony more travellers\\r\\n\\n\\nthe night,” said old Andy, as he shook his shawl free from the clinging\\r\\n\\n\\nrain drops, and hung it up in its place.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now sit ye down in your own comfortable chair, gudeman, and I’ll brew\\r\\n\\n\\nye a bowl o’ hot punch. Eh, hinney, ye’ll be needing it after sic’ an\\r\\n\\n\\nexposure to the elements,” said Jenny, as she replaced the kettle over\\r\\n\\n\\nthe blaze, and drew Andy’s old arm-chair before the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith a sigh of infinite relief, he let himself sink into the inviting\\r\\n\\n\\nseat, kicked off his heavy shoes, and stretched his stockinged feet to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe genial warmth of the hearth. Andy did not rejoice in the luxury of a\\r\\n\\n\\npair of slippers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh, Jenny, woman, it’s good to feel oneself at ease at one’s own\\r\\n\\n\\nfireside at last,” said the old man, as he took from the hand of his\\r\\n\\n\\nwife a smoking tumbler of punch.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘It’s hot as love,’ as you say,” she nodded.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh, so it is; what’s the hour, gudewife?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It’s gone weel on to ten,” she answered, glancing at the tall old clock\\r\\n\\n\\nthat stood in the corner, and reached from floor to ceiling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I’se gaun to bed immediately, no to be bothered wi’ any more\\r\\n\\n\\ntravellers the night,” said Andy, blowing and sipping his punch.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Andy reckoned without his host, as many of his betters do.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJust at that moment there came a rap at the door, so low, however, that\\r\\n\\n\\nit could scarcely be heard amid the roaring of the storm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYet both husband and wife turned and listened.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was repeated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What’s that?” asked Andy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There’s some one outside,” said Jenny.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe rap was reiterated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who the de’il can it be, at this unlawful hour o’ the night? Gae see,\\r\\n\\n\\nJenny, woman. And if it’s ony vagrants bang the door in their faces.\\r\\n\\n\\nI’se no be troubled wi’ ony more callers the night!” cried the old man,\\r\\n\\n\\nimpatiently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore he had well done grumbling, the old woman had gone to the door\\r\\n\\n\\nand opened it, letting in a furious blast of wind and rain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gude guide us!” she exclaimed, starting back, aghast, at what she saw\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What the de’il is it then, gude wife?” nervously demanded Andy,\\r\\n\\n\\nstarting up and seizing his old musket from its hooks above the\\r\\n\\n\\nchimney-piece. Andy was thinking only of thieves, as is usual with many\\r\\n\\n\\nwho have little to lose.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Pit up your gun, gude man, it’s no what ye think,” said Jenny, once\\r\\n\\n\\nmore approaching the door to peep out at the wretch that stood dripping\\r\\n\\n\\nand shivering outside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“For the love of Heaven, let me in a little while. I will not stay many\\r\\n\\n\\nminutes,” pleaded a plaintive voice from the darkness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who is it?” inquired Andy, coming cautiously forward in his stocking\\r\\n\\n\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It’s some poor lassie, as far as I can make out. Come in wi’ ye then,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Jenny, stretching the door wide open, though the wind and the rain\\r\\n\\n\\nrushed in, flooding the floor where they stood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ay, come in, and ye maun, and dinna stand there like a lunatic keeping\\r\\n\\n\\nthe door open and letting in the weather,” growled Andy, as he toddled\\r\\n\\n\\nback to his comfortable chair and dropped into it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore he had half uttered his churlish invitation, the stranger had\\r\\n\\n\\nentered, and now stood in the room, with the rain running from her dark\\r\\n\\n\\nraiment, while Jenny shut and bolted the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now then, who are ye? and what brings ye tramping on sic a night as\\r\\n\\n\\nthis?” sternly demanded Andy, as he turned and stared at the stranger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe wore a long dark gray cloak with a hood; the cloak completely\\r\\n\\n\\nconcealed her form and its hood overshadowed her face. That was all that\\r\\n\\n\\nAndy could make of her appearance then.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who are ye, I ask, and where are ye gaun the night,” he angrily\\r\\n\\n\\nrepeated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe stranger did not answer except by dropping her face upon her open\\r\\n\\n\\nhands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Andy, dinna ye see she canna speak? For the sake of our own poor lost\\r\\n\\n\\nKatie, we maun have pity. Come away to the fire, my poor lass, and dry\\r\\n\\n\\nyour clothes, whiles I get ye something warm to take the chill out o’\\r\\n\\n\\nyour poor shivering body,” said Jenny, kindly placing her hand upon the\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl’s shoulder and gently urging her towards the fire-place.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’m of opinion that ye’d better find out who she is, and where she came\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom, and where she’s gaun, before ye press upon her the hospitalities\\r\\n\\n\\nof an honest house,” grumbled Mr. Birney.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Whist, gude man! I might speer a dizzen questions, but dinna ye see for\\r\\n\\n\\nyoursel’ that she’s in na condition to answer ane?” said Jenny, in a low\\r\\n\\n\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAndy growled something in which the words “tramping hizzy” were the only\\r\\n\\n\\nones audible.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, let me hae your cloak, hinny, to hang it up to dry. See, it’s\\r\\n\\n\\nwringing wet. Nay, nay, dinna resist gude offices,” said Mrs. Birney,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith kind persistence, as she saw that the girl made some little, mute,\\r\\n\\n\\npathetic resistance to the removal of her outer garment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJenny gently took it off her and hung it on the back of a chair to dry\\r\\n\\n\\nby the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the young stranger stood revealed in all her loveliness and sorrow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was a young, slight, graceful creature, with a thin, pale face, dark\\r\\n\\n\\nhair and dark eyebrows, long, black eye-lashes, and large, soft, gray\\r\\n\\n\\neyes, so full of pleading sadness that their glances went straight to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe heart of Jenny Birney. It was a child’s face; but ah, woe! it was a\\r\\n\\n\\nmatron’s form revealed there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wae-sooks!” exclaimed the good wife in consternation, as she gazed upon\\r\\n\\n\\nthe young thing, and saw that, child-like as she looked, she had been\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried, or——ought to have been.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAgain the little, pale hands went up and covered the little, woe-forn\\r\\n\\n\\nface.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sit ye down,” said Mrs. Birney, kindly. “Ye are no able to stand.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she drew her own low, cushioned chair to the chimney corner, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwith gentle force pushed the poor child into it. And then she took down\\r\\n\\n\\nher little black tea-pot from the corner cupboard and began to make tea.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Birney watched the process in strong disapprobation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis wife raised a deprecating glance to his face, murmuring, in a low\\r\\n\\n\\ntone:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“We maun be pitiful, Andy! for our poor lost Katy’s sake, we maun be\\r\\n\\n\\npitiful.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe answered that appeal by growling forth the words:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Aweel, aweel, Jenny woman, hae your ain way! hae your ain way! Eh! but\\r\\n\\n\\nye’ve had it these forty years and mair! And it’s no likely that ye’ll\\r\\n\\n\\ngie it up now!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so saying, the old man put his pipe in his mouth and resigned\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself to circumstances.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Birney made a cup of tea and a round of toast, and set them on a\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle stand beside her guest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now eat and drink and ye’ll be better. Nay, nay, dinna shake your poor\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle head! do as I bid ye. I had a child o’ my ain once. She has been\\r\\n\\n\\nin heaven, I hope, these twenty years. Sae ye see I hae a soft place in\\r\\n\\n\\nmy heart for children, especially for lassies; sae eat and drink, and be\\r\\n\\n\\ncomforted and strengthened, and then maybe ye’ll tell me how ye came to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe out in the weather, and what I can do for ye besides giving you a bit\\r\\n\\n\\nand sup and a bed to lie on,” coaxed the good woman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks, thanks,” murmured the girl, as she raised the cup, and with a\\r\\n\\n\\nfeverish thirst eagerly drank the tea.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Try some of the toast. It is done with milk; it will nourish ye,”\\r\\n\\n\\nhospitably urged Jenny.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please—I cannot eat a morsel, and—I must go now,” answered the young\\r\\n\\n\\nstranger, rising.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Go now! Are ye daft?” exclaimed Mrs. Birney, in dismay; while Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nBirney took the pipe from his mouth and stared.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, I am not ‘daft,’ though I know how mad my purpose must seem,”\\r\\n\\n\\ncalmly answered the girl, taking her cloak from the chair upon which it\\r\\n\\n\\nwas drying by the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—I thought ye came here for a night’s lodging, and——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no; I had no such design,” sighed the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—an ye didna come for a night’s lodging, what _did_ ye come for?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I was nearly spent with struggling on in the face of the tempest. I was\\r\\n\\n\\nso beaten by the wind and the rain that I thought I should have dropped\\r\\n\\n\\nand died; I almost wish I had. But I saw the light in your window and I\\r\\n\\n\\ntried to reach it, and I did. I came in only to rest and breathe a\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle while, and get strength to go on again.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But where did ye come from, my poor child?” inquired the pitying woman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I came from Washington by the stage-coach. It put me down at the Cross\\r\\n\\n\\nRoads, ten miles from this place.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gude save us! and ye walked all that way through the storm?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, and was nearly exhausted; but now, thanks to your charity, I feel\\r\\n\\n\\nrefreshed, and able to pursue my journey,” said the young girl, as she\\r\\n\\n\\ntied her cloak, and drew its hood over her head.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, then, and ye’ll no do onything o’ the sort. Eh, sirs, are we\\r\\n\\n\\nheathen to let a wee bit lassie gae forth alane on sic a stormy\\r\\n\\n\\nwinter-night as this, when we wouldna turn an enemy’s dog from the door?\\r\\n\\n\\nSit ye down, my lass, and dinna ye mind the gudeman’s growling. His bark\\r\\n\\n\\nis aye worse than his bite,” said Mrs. Birney.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd here Mr. Birney took his pipe from his mouth, and spoke these\\r\\n\\n\\ngracious words:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bide ye here for the present, an’ ye will. I dinna like tramps as a\\r\\n\\n\\npermanent institution in the house, but I’ll no turn ye out into the\\r\\n\\n\\nstorm, sae bide where ye be.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd having uttered this oracle, old Andy replaced his pipe between his\\r\\n\\n\\nlips, and smoked vigorously to make up for lost time.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ye hear what the gudeman says? Hark ye now to the wisdom of age, and\\r\\n\\n\\nbide ye quiet till I make ye a bed, and I’ll wrap ye weel and pit ye\\r\\n\\n\\nwarm to sleep the night, and in the morn ye may gae where ye like.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks—a thousand thanks for your dear mercy! but in the morning it\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be too late. Ah, heaven, yes!” exclaimed the girl, as a sudden\\r\\n\\n\\nterror wildly dilated her large gray eyes. “I must go on to-night, or\\r\\n\\n\\nfail, where failure would be despair and death!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gae on to-night! Gude save us! gae on where?” exclaimed the wondering\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To Old Lyon Hall,” answered the stranger, moving towards the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stay—come back! Ye are stark daft! To the Hall?” cried Jenny, following\\r\\n\\n\\nher guest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, to the old Hall,” said the stranger, pausing courteously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, that’s where the grand wedding will be the night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know it,” said the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—ye’ll surely no be one o’ the invited guests?” exclaimed Jenny in\\r\\n\\n\\nbewilderment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no,” replied the girl, with a strange smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Look ye, lass. Who be ye? What be your name, an ye have no objection to\\r\\n\\n\\ntell it?” gravely inquired Mrs. Birney.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have no objection to tell my name; it has never been sullied by\\r\\n\\n\\ndishonor; it is Anna Lyon,” replied the girl, with her hand upon the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor-latch.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“ANNA LYON! Sign us, and save us! that is the name of the bride that is\\r\\n\\n\\nto be married to-night!” cried Jenny Birney, aghast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know it is,” quietly replied the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And ye hae the same name?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The very same,” said the stranger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gude save us! then ye’ll be kin to the family?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, no kin,” answered the girl, calmly. Then to herself she murmured,\\r\\n\\n\\n“_I_—‘a little more than kin,’ _he_ ‘a little less than kind.’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What are ye muttering to yoursel’? Ye say ye’re no kin to the family,\\r\\n\\n\\nand if ye are no, what will be taking you to the old Hall the night?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Something more than a matter of life and death! And oh, I must be\\r\\n\\n\\ngone!” said the girl, with the same look of terror that she had shown\\r\\n\\n\\nonce before, now smiting all the remaining color from her pale face, and\\r\\n\\n\\nleaving it white as marble.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good-bye—good-bye, and a thousand heart-felt thanks for all your\\r\\n\\n\\nkindness,” she added.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile she spoke she deftly slid the bolts of the door, and as she ceased\\r\\n\\n\\nshe quickly slipped through it, and ran away like one who feared to be\\r\\n\\n\\nhindered or pursued.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stop! stop!” screamed Jenny, rushing after her, and looking out into\\r\\n\\n\\nthe night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut her strange visitor had vanished in the darkness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hech! she’s clean daft, and she’ll perish in the storm!” cried Jenny in\\r\\n\\n\\nconsternation, as she drew in her head.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come away, gudewife, and shut the door!” bawled old Andy, provoked past\\r\\n\\n\\nhis patience.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh, gude man, rin—rin after her. Ye may catch her an ye start now,”\\r\\n\\n\\nprayed Jenny, pulling down her husband’s shawl from its peg, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthrowing it over his shoulders—“rin, rin for your life, Andy!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“De’il be in my legs, then, if I budge a foot from the fire! I’m in a\\r\\n\\n\\ncondition to rin, am I no? wi’ both my shoes off and mysel’ soaking wi’\\r\\n\\n\\nsweat! I’ll no rin for ony daft lass or lad in Christendom!” grumbled\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But for the Lord’s sake, Andy!” pleaded the woman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I would do onything in reason for the Lord’s sake, an’ He distinctly\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled me, but I’m no conscious of any special call to pit myself\\r\\n\\n\\nforward in this work. Sae just shut up the house, Jenny, woman, and come\\r\\n\\n\\naway to bed. And I’ll no open again this night to man or woman, saint or\\r\\n\\n\\ndevil, so there, now!” growled old Andy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’se shut the door, but I’se nae shut the window. And I’se no gaun to\\r\\n\\n\\nbed this night, I’se sit up and show a light, if the poor wandering\\r\\n\\n\\nlassie behooves to come back,” said Mrs. Birney, firmly, as she fastened\\r\\n\\n\\nthe door, and sat the lantern on the little stand under the window, with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe light turned towards the road.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The more fool you,” observed Mr. Birney, as he began to draw off his\\r\\n\\n\\nstockings, and prepare himself for his bed, that stood conveniently\\r\\n\\n\\nnear, in a recess curtained off from the other portion of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Birney drew her spinning wheel to the chimney corner nearest the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow, where she had placed the light, and she sat down and began to\\r\\n\\n\\nspin.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ye’ll no be whirling that machine and keeping me awake, Jenny, woman!”\\r\\n\\n\\nexpostulated the old man as he got into bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But if I maun sit up, I maun na lose my time.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then knit or sew.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe good-humoredly put aside her wheel and took from the top of the\\r\\n\\n\\ncorner cupboard her work-basket half filled with woolen socks, which she\\r\\n\\n\\nsat down to darn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Andy was soon snoring under his blankets.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJenny sat darning and sighing, and occasionally peering through the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow into the darkness without. The violence of the storm seemed to be\\r\\n\\n\\nsubsiding, though still it rained heavily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It’s like murder,” she murmured. “And, if she be found cold and dead in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe morn I shall never forgi’e mysel’. I shall never be able to sleep\\r\\n\\n\\nagain. Eh! but I wish I had rin out after her mysel.’ But then the\\r\\n\\n\\ngudeman would na hae let me. Hech! but they get hard and selfish wi’ age\\r\\n\\n\\nand infirmities, these men. Eh! how he sleeps and snores, as if there\\r\\n\\n\\nwas no misery in the world,” she added, glancing at the bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the old curmudgeon’s rest was destined to be broken.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere came the sound of horse’s hoofs dashing along the flooded road.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe toll-gate bar was cleared at a bound. Jenny heard the spring and\\r\\n\\n\\nsplash, and she started to her feet, dropping her work-basket.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next moment there came a loud rapping at the door. It aroused the\\r\\n\\n\\nold man from his sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What the de’il is that?” he exclaimed, angrily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There’s ane without,” whispered Jenny, in a scared tone, trembling in\\r\\n\\n\\nspite of herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Worse luck! Is it a Witch’s Sabbath and are all the warlocks and\\r\\n\\n\\nwitches riding to it by this road the night?” he growled.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe knocking grew louder.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who is it, Jenny?” he cried.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I dinna know,” whispered the woman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Canna ye gae and see?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe knocking became vociferous, the horseman seemed to be hammering at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe door with the loaded end of his riding-whip.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Haud your noise out there, will you then!” bawled the old man, bouncing\\r\\n\\n\\nout of bed, throwing a blanket around him and seizing his blunderbus,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile Jenny crept to the door and cautiously opened it, keeping herself\\r\\n\\n\\nbehind it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe rain had nearly ceased and the sky was clearing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA tall, stout, dark man, in a dark riding-coat, stood outside. With one\\r\\n\\n\\nhand he held the bridle of his horse, and with the other the handle of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis riding-whip, with which he had just rapped.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo much Jenny, cautiously peeping around the edge of the door, could\\r\\n\\n\\nmake out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old toll-taker came forward, wrapped in his blanket like a North\\r\\n\\n\\nAmerican Indian, and carrying his musket in his hand, and growling:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Am I no to have ony peace or quiet the night? I’d as weel be keeper o’\\r\\n\\n\\none o’ these new-fangled railway stations where the trains are aye\\r\\n\\n\\ncoming and going day and night, instead o’ this once quiet toll-gate.\\r\\n\\n\\nWho be ye, sir, and what’s your will?” he growled at this second\\r\\n\\n\\nstranger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am a traveller going to Old Lyon Hall; and I wish to know the nearest\\r\\n\\n\\nroad,” answered the horseman. But a sudden parting blast of wind drowned\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf his words.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And by the way, how came ye on this side of the road, when the great\\r\\n\\n\\nbar is up for the night?” angrily demanded the toll-taker.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, my horse took it at a bound.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“An he had broken your neck it might hae been a gude job and saved the\\r\\n\\n\\nhangman trouble,” growled old Andy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks,” laughed the stranger, “but there was not a chance of it; my\\r\\n\\n\\nhorse is a famous hunter. Will you direct me on my road?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Where_ did you say you were going?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To Old Lyon Hall.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To Old Lyon Hall!—Jenny, woman, here is anither one! It’s _there_ they\\r\\n\\n\\nare holding the witches’ dance and no wedding, for the warlocks and\\r\\n\\n\\nwitches that flit by this way are no wedding guests,” said the old man,\\r\\n\\n\\nturning to his wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will you be so good as to direct me to the Hall?” courteously persisted\\r\\n\\n\\nthe traveller.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, ay, I’ll direct ye fast enough; but be ye’ one o’ the wedding\\r\\n\\n\\nguests?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, not exactly,” laughed the man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hark to him Jenny! how much he talks like the ither one! Then what’s\\r\\n\\n\\nyour business at the Hall the night? It’s unco late to make a visit, and\\r\\n\\n\\nvarry oncivil to go oninvited where they’re handing a bridal. Wouldna\\r\\n\\n\\nthe morn serve your turn just as weel?” mockingly inquired Andy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; the morning would be too late for my purpose. It is of the utmost\\r\\n\\n\\nimportance that I should reach the Hall to-night!” said the horseman,\\r\\n\\n\\nbeginning to grow restive under the influence of some hidden anxiety\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he could not entirely conceal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is it an affair of ‘life and death?’” inquired Andy, with a touch of\\r\\n\\n\\nsarcasm in his tone, as he repeated the words that had been used by the\\r\\n\\n\\nunhappy girl who had preceded this stranger on this road.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“More—much more than life and death is involved,” muttered the\\r\\n\\n\\ntraveller, in a voice vibrating with the agitation that he could no\\r\\n\\n\\nlonger control.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hark to him again, Jenny!” grinned the old man. “Just the way the ither\\r\\n\\n\\none talked. The de’il maun be holding a levee at the Hall!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I beg you will not detain me; pray put me on my road,” impatiently\\r\\n\\n\\nurged the stranger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, ay! ye see the road before ye. Ye’ll just face it and follow your\\r\\n\\n\\nnose, and it will lead to the old Hall. Ye canna miss it. It stands off\\r\\n\\n\\nabout a quarter mile from the road, on the right. There’s woods before\\r\\n\\n\\nit, and the Porcupine Mountains behind it. It will be the first grand\\r\\n\\n\\nlike mansion ye’ll come to, and the only one, an’ ye were to ride a\\r\\n\\n\\nhunder miles in that direction.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks,” said the stranger, lifting his cap and remounting his horse.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And oh, kind gentleman,” said Jenny, coming forward, “an’ ye should\\r\\n\\n\\nmeet wi’ a poor daft lassie who gaed before on the same road, ye’ll no\\r\\n\\n\\nlet her perish for the want of a helping hand. For the love of the Lord,\\r\\n\\n\\nye’ll get her under shelter or bring her back here.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘A poor daft lassie,’” repeated the stranger, bewildered by the woman’s\\r\\n\\n\\nwords and manner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ay, sir; a poor bit child wha canna guide hersel’ to ony gude end.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A young tramp, sir,” explained the old man. “A young tramp who passed\\r\\n\\n\\nthis way an hour ago; and ye should get her pit into a House of\\r\\n\\n\\nCorrection, ye might be doing her good service.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have no time to stop, but if I should see the young woman I will do\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat I can for her. Good night,” said the traveller, putting spurs to\\r\\n\\n\\nhis horse, and galloping away as if determined not to be detained\\r\\n\\n\\nanother moment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what, Jenny, there’s something unco wrong up at the old\\r\\n\\n\\nHall! And now shut up the house and come away to bed,” said old Andy,\\r\\n\\n\\nturning from the door, and dragging his blanket behind him like a court\\r\\n\\n\\ntrain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I couldna sleep a wink wi’out hearing what becomes o’ that poor\\r\\n\\n\\nhouseless child. I’ll sit up and sew, and show a light i’ the window, in\\r\\n\\n\\ncase she behooves to come back again,” replied Mrs. Birney, replacing\\r\\n\\n\\nthe lantern on the stand before the window, resuming her seat on her low\\r\\n\\n\\nchair in the chimney corner, and taking up her work, while the old man,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the last time that night, shut up the house and went to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\n\\n                            AT THE OLD HALL.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n              Yes, there thou art below the hill,\\r\\n\\n\\n              By evergreens encircled still,\\r\\n\\n\\n              Old hall that time hath deigned to spare,\\r\\n\\n\\n              Mid rugged rocks and forests fair,\\r\\n\\n\\n              And nightshade o’er the casement creeping,\\r\\n\\n\\n              And owlet in the crevice sleeping,\\r\\n\\n\\n              And antique chairs and broidered bed,\\r\\n\\n\\n              By housewife’s patient needle spread.—ANON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Lyon Hall lay at the foot of the Porcupine, an offshoot of the\\r\\n\\n\\nAlleghanies, in one of the wildest and most picturesque counties in\\r\\n\\n\\nVirginia.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was built in the Tudor style of domestic architecture, very\\r\\n\\n\\nirregularly, with many gable ends, gothic windows and twisted chimneys.\\r\\n\\n\\nIts walls of old red sandstone contrasted gloomily with the dark hue of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe evergreen trees that bristled up above it, and gave the mountain its\\r\\n\\n\\ndescriptive name.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHeavy woods, bare, gray crags, and tumbling torrents surrounded it, and\\r\\n\\n\\ngave a savage and sombre aspect to the scene. Below the Hall a turbulent\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle river, spanned by a rustic bridge, rushed and roared along its\\r\\n\\n\\nrocky bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Hall was very old. It had been built nearly two hundred years ago by\\r\\n\\n\\na Scotchman named Saul Sauvage Lyon, who had received a grant of the\\r\\n\\n\\nland from James the First. It had remained ever since in the family of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe founder, whose descendants had frequently distinguished themselves,\\r\\n\\n\\nas soldiers, or statesmen, in every epoch of the country’s history,\\r\\n\\n\\neither as a colony or a commonwealth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSome few years since, being the date of this story, the master of the\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Lyon Hall and Manor was General Leonard Lyon, a retired army\\r\\n\\n\\nofficer, and a veteran of the war of eighteen hundred and twelve.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon had married very early in his youth, and had enjoyed many\\r\\n\\n\\nyears of calm domestic happiness. But now his wife and children were all\\r\\n\\n\\ndead, and his only living descendant was his grandchild, the beautiful\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna Lyon, “sole daughter of ‘his’ house.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAdded to the great sorrow of bereavement was vexation, that, for the\\r\\n\\n\\nwant of male heirs, his old family estate must at last “fall to the\\r\\n\\n\\ndistaff.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut there might be found a remedy to this lesser evil.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon had a younger brother, Chief Justice Lyon, of Richmond. And\\r\\n\\n\\nthe chief justice had an only son.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYoung Alexander Lyon was a bright, handsome, attractive lad, a few years\\r\\n\\n\\nolder than his cousin Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUnder all the circumstances, if it was not perfectly proper, it was at\\r\\n\\n\\nleast natural and pardonable that old General Lyon should wish his\\r\\n\\n\\ngrand-daughter to become the wife of his nephew, so that while she\\r\\n\\n\\ninherited his estate, she might perpetuate his name.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nQuite early in the childhood of the boy and girl, the general proposed\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir betrothal to the chief justice, who eagerly acceded to the plan.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so the affair was settled—by the parents. It was not considered\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessary to consult the children.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander was sent to Yale College, where, for a few years, he led\\r\\n\\n\\nrather a fast life for a student.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Anna was placed at a fashionable boarding school in New York, where\\r\\n\\n\\nshe had a great deal more liberty than was good for her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTwice a year the young persons were permitted to meet—when they spent\\r\\n\\n\\nthe midsummer vacation at old Lyon Hall, where the chief justice and his\\r\\n\\n\\nwife also came on a visit to the general, and when they kept the\\r\\n\\n\\nChristmas holidays at the splendid town house of the chief justice at\\r\\n\\n\\nRichmond, where the general also went to pay back his brother’s visit.\\r\\n\\n\\nThis arrangement was of course very agreeable to all parties.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut as the boy and girl grew towards manhood and womanhood, it was\\r\\n\\n\\nthought well to change this routine. And so, sometimes in the midsummer\\r\\n\\n\\nvacation, the whole party, consisting of both families, would go for a\\r\\n\\n\\ntour through the most attractive places of summer resort. And at\\r\\n\\n\\nChristmas they would keep the holidays in Washington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn all these occasions the young lady and gentleman, under the auspices\\r\\n\\n\\nof their elders, entered very freely into the fashionable amusements of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe season, with the understanding, however, that they were not to fall\\r\\n\\n\\nin love, or even to flirt with any one but each other.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon and Mr. Alexander seemed at first to have no particular\\r\\n\\n\\nobjection to this arrangement. They had always been fond of each other,\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch fonder than of any one else. But ah! theirs was not the love that\\r\\n\\n\\nwould excuse, much less justify marriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt has been said that when two persons of like complexion and\\r\\n\\n\\ntemperament intermarry, wise nature and sacred love have had nothing to\\r\\n\\n\\ndo with the union. And the truth spoken to-day is as old as the creation\\r\\n\\n\\nof man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna and Alexander were of the same complexion and the same temperament;\\r\\n\\n\\nboth were plump, fair, blue-eyed and yellow-haired, both lively and fond\\r\\n\\n\\nof pleasure, and both, on the surface, and in matters of little moment,\\r\\n\\n\\nwere amiable and yielding, but below the surface, and in affairs of\\r\\n\\n\\nimportance, resolute and determined as destiny and death. In person and\\r\\n\\n\\nin character they were as much alike as twin brother and sister.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis similarity, while it made their association as relatives very\\r\\n\\n\\nagreeable, utterly precluded the possibility of their becoming lovers,\\r\\n\\n\\nin the common sense of the word. They did not know this, when their\\r\\n\\n\\nhearts were entirely free from any other attachment that might have\\r\\n\\n\\nawakened their consciousness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was no immediate hurry about the projected marriage. It was\\r\\n\\n\\ncertain to take place, the parents concluded, and so they neither\\r\\n\\n\\nworried themselves nor their children prematurely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander had to finish his college course, to graduate and to make the\\r\\n\\n\\n“grand tour,” as was usual with young gentlemen of his position.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen he should have accomplished all this, he would be about\\r\\n\\n\\ntwenty-three years of age and his bride elect would be about\\r\\n\\n\\neighteen—both quite young enough to marry, the old folks argued.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe plan was partly carried out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander Lyon graduated with honors and embarked for Europe. He\\r\\n\\n\\ntravelled over quite a considerable portion of the Eastern Continent. He\\r\\n\\n\\nwas gone two years, at the end of which he returned to claim his\\r\\n\\n\\npromised bride.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nActive preparations were made for the marriage. But fate seemed to be\\r\\n\\n\\nagainst it. A few days before the one set apart for the ceremony, while\\r\\n\\n\\nthe whole of both families were assembled at Old Lyon Hall to do honor\\r\\n\\n\\nto the occasion, Chief Justice Lyon was suddenly struck dead by\\r\\n\\n\\napoplexy. Instead of a wedding there was a funeral, and the family went\\r\\n\\n\\ninto mourning for a year.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt the end of that time preparations were again made for the marriage,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich was again arrested by the hand of death.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA malignant fever was prevailing, and Mrs. Lyon, the widow of the chief\\r\\n\\n\\njustice, was one of its first victims.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length, at the close of this second term of mourning and seclusion,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe household awoke as from a nightmare dream and busied itself with\\r\\n\\n\\nblithe bridal affairs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe splendid city mansion and the fine old country house of the late\\r\\n\\n\\nchief justice were both renovated and refurnished in costly style for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe reception of the new mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was settled that the marriage should take place early in November. In\\r\\n\\n\\naccordance with the old-time prejudices of General Lyon, it was to be\\r\\n\\n\\nsolemnized, in the evening, in the great drawing-room of Old Lyon Hall,\\r\\n\\n\\nin the presence of a large party of friends, who were afterwards to be\\r\\n\\n\\nentertained with a ball and supper. The bride and groom were to leave\\r\\n\\n\\nthe next morning for a short tour, after which they were to go to\\r\\n\\n\\nRichmond and settle down for the winter in their town house, where they\\r\\n\\n\\nwere to be joined by the general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSuch was the arrangement. But “man proposes and”—you know the rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe autumn weather that had been glorious with the “excess of glory” in\\r\\n\\n\\na genial, refulgent and prolonged Indian Summer, suddenly changed. The\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding-day dawned threateningly. No sun shone on it. Heavy black clouds\\r\\n\\n\\ndarkened the sky; wild, mournful winds wailed through the woods; violent\\r\\n\\n\\ngusts of rain dashed suddenly down at intervals and as suddenly ceased.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe inmates of the old Hall watched the weather in hope and fear. Would\\r\\n\\n\\nit clear up? Or would it grow worse? they asked themselves and each\\r\\n\\n\\nother. Certainly there was no sign of its clearing; quite the contrary,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor as the day declined the storm thickened.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFires were kindled in every room of the old house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the great drawing-room the two broad fire-places, one at each end,\\r\\n\\n\\nwere piled high with huge hickory logs, that were burning and blazing\\r\\n\\n\\nand filling the long room with glowing light and genial warmth, all the\\r\\n\\n\\nmore comfortable and delightful in contrast to the tempestuous weather\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout—shining on the tall brass andirons and fender; shining on the\\r\\n\\n\\npolished oak floor, with its rich Turkey rugs laid before each\\r\\n\\n\\nfire-place and sofa; shining on the wainscotted walls with their\\r\\n\\n\\ntime-honored family portraits; shining on the bright black walnut\\r\\n\\n\\nfurniture; and on every surface and point that could reflect a ray of\\r\\n\\n\\nlight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis fine old-fashioned drawing-room was as yet vacant, waiting for the\\r\\n\\n\\nevening crowd of wedding guests, if indeed the state of the weather and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe roads should permit them to assemble.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFires were kindled in the long dining-room, where a sumptuous supper was\\r\\n\\n\\nlaid out for the expected company; and in all the bed-chambers which had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen opened and aired, cleaned and decorated for such of the guests as\\r\\n\\n\\nshould come from a distance, and need to change their dress and perhaps\\r\\n\\n\\nto lie down and rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn one of the most spacious and comfortable of these upper-chambers,\\r\\n\\n\\nlate in the afternoon of this day, sat the bride elect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe reclined in an easy chair, with her feet upon the fender and her\\r\\n\\n\\neyes fixed moodily, dreamily upon the glowing fire before her, and\\r\\n\\n\\nlistened to the beating storm without.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere in this room, also, the ruddy blaze shone on dark wainscotted\\r\\n\\n\\nwalls, relieved by crimson damask window curtains, and on a polished\\r\\n\\n\\noaken floor, bare of carpets, except for the rugs that lay upon the\\r\\n\\n\\nhearth before the dressing-table and beside the bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was indeed a lonely, silent, sombre scene in which to find a maiden\\r\\n\\n\\non her bridal evening. The tempest raged without, and the wind and rain\\r\\n\\n\\nbeat against the walls and windows as if they would batter them down. In\\r\\n\\n\\nthe pauses of the storm she could hear the rushing of the swollen\\r\\n\\n\\ntorrents and the roaring of the rising river. She knew that the roads\\r\\n\\n\\nmust be almost impassable and the streams unfordable. In truth, no one\\r\\n\\n\\nhad bargained for such weather on the wedding-day.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOf the hundred and fifty guests who had been invited, not one had yet\\r\\n\\n\\nappeared; not one of her bridesmaids; not the minister who was to\\r\\n\\n\\nperform the marriage ceremony; not even her bridegroom! And yet all\\r\\n\\n\\nthese had been expected at an early hour of the afternoon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEverything was ready for their reception and for the rites and festivals\\r\\n\\n\\nof the evening. Every nook and corner of the genial old home smiled its\\r\\n\\n\\nwelcome in anticipation of the arrival of these expected guests; and yet\\r\\n\\n\\nnot one of them came.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNor, when she listened to the howling of the tempest without, could the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung bride elect wonder at their absence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer rich and varied wardrobe and her rare and costly jewels were all\\r\\n\\n\\npacked in half a dozen large travelling-trunks that stood ready for\\r\\n\\n\\nremoval outside her chamber door in the upper hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer wedding-dress of rich white velvet, her large veil of fine lace, her\\r\\n\\n\\nwreath of orange-flowers, and all the accessories of her bridal costume\\r\\n\\n\\nlay out upon the bed. Yet she doubted that she should be called to wear\\r\\n\\n\\nthem that night: and she sat still gazing into the fire, listening to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe storm, and making no motion towards her toilet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked a beautiful young creature as she sat there, with her\\r\\n\\n\\ngraceful form, her perfect features, her pure complexion, her soft blue\\r\\n\\n\\neyes and pale yellow hair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOf what was she dreaming as she sat gazing into the fire, and heaving\\r\\n\\n\\ndeep, heavy sighs? Surely not only of the storm and the trifling delay\\r\\n\\n\\nof her marriage, for she must have known that it could only be a\\r\\n\\n\\nquestion of a few hours, and that whoever might stay away, her\\r\\n\\n\\nbridegroom would certainly keep his appointment. What serious subject of\\r\\n\\n\\nthought had she? what _possible_ subject of grief? Idlest with youth,\\r\\n\\n\\nhealth and beauty, with high birth, great wealth and many\\r\\n\\n\\naccomplishments, about to form the most brilliant marriage of the year,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith a gentleman who seemed her equal in all respects, if not her\\r\\n\\n\\nsuperior in some, about to preside over the most splendid establishment\\r\\n\\n\\nin the city and the grandest old house in the country, and to reign\\r\\n\\n\\neverywhere a queen in society, what imaginable cause of discontent could\\r\\n\\n\\nshe have?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh, friends! did ever any of these things, in themselves alone, satisfy\\r\\n\\n\\nthe hunger of any human heart—make any living creature happy?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe darling daughter, the rich heiress, the beautiful bride elect, sat\\r\\n\\n\\nand sighed and gazed, and gazed and sighed as if her heart would break.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere were secrets in the life of this motherless girl unknown to her\\r\\n\\n\\nnearest relatives, unsuspected by her appointed bridegroom. Of that more\\r\\n\\n\\nhereafter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe sat there without moving until dark afternoon deepened into black\\r\\n\\n\\nnight, and the raging of the storm became terrific. How long she would\\r\\n\\n\\nhave sat thus I do not know, for just as the little toy of a clock upon\\r\\n\\n\\nher mantle-piece chimed nine her door opened, and her own maid, Matty,\\r\\n\\n\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I told you not to bring lights until I should ring for them,” said Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon, impatiently turning her head.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know, Miss Anna; I didn’t bring no lights. I come to tell you how\\r\\n\\n\\nMarse Alesander has jus’ arroved.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He has come—and through all this storm?” exclaimed Anna in a startled\\r\\n\\n\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Miss, which Old Marse as’ed if you was ready, and sent me up to\\r\\n\\n\\n’quire.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I can be ready soon, Matty. But—has any one else come?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not the minister?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The which, Miss?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The Reverend Doctor Barbar.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I don’t see the use of my disturbing myself yet awhile. There can\\r\\n\\n\\nbe no marriage without a minister,” said the bride elect, with something\\r\\n\\n\\nvery much like a sigh of relief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You may go, Matilda,” she added to the girl, who still lingered at the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMatty vanished, and Miss Lyon resigned herself to her reverie.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA few minutes passed, and Matty reappeared.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What now?” demanded the young lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please, Miss, ole Marse have sent Jacob, with the close carriage, to\\r\\n\\n\\nfetch the min’s’er, and say he will be here in half an hour if you will\\r\\n\\n\\nget ready.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Matty, where is your master?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In his study, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alone?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where is Mr. Alexander?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He’s gone up to his own room, Miss, to fix hisself.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very well,” said the young lady, as she arose and left her chamber.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe passed up the broad upper hall that was now ruddy and cheerful with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe light of many fires, that shone through the open doors of the\\r\\n\\n\\nwaiting bedrooms, and she went straight to the little room with the bay\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow, at the front end, over the main entrance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe opened the door and found her grandfather seated in his big\\r\\n\\n\\narm-chair by his writing table, on which lay books, papers, pens, and so\\r\\n\\n\\nforth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the old gentleman was neither reading nor writing. He was simply\\r\\n\\n\\nsitting and waiting.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was a very fine-looking old man, tall and stout, with a full face,\\r\\n\\n\\nnoble features, fair complexion, and snow white hair and beard. He wore\\r\\n\\n\\nan evening dress of black broadcloth, with a white vest and white\\r\\n\\n\\ncravat. His white gloves lay beside him, ready for use.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All alone, gran’pa?” inquired Anna, smiling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, my pet—yes, my darling,” said the old gentleman, rising and\\r\\n\\n\\nhanding his grand-daughter to a seat with as much courtesy as if she\\r\\n\\n\\nwere a princess. “But why are you not dressed, Anna? It is late, very\\r\\n\\n\\nlate.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, gran’pa, what an awful night for a wedding! And there is no one\\r\\n\\n\\nhere, and no one likely to come.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, my dear, but it is the night appointed, and your bridegroom is in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house, and the minister will soon be here.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gran’pa,” pleaded Anna, leaving her seat and coming and sitting on his\\r\\n\\n\\nknee, and putting her arm caressingly around his neck—“dear gran’pa, I\\r\\n\\n\\ncannot bear to be married under these evil auspices, without witnesses,\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout bridesmaids, and on a dark night and in a heavy storm. Why\\r\\n\\n\\ncannot the marriage be deferred until to-morrow morning? What difference\\r\\n\\n\\ncan a few hours make? At least, what difference that is not very\\r\\n\\n\\ndesirable? By to-morrow the storm will be over. The ceremony can be\\r\\n\\n\\nperformed early in the morning. I can be married in my travelling dress.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe supper will do for a breakfast. And we can start immediately upon\\r\\n\\n\\nour wedding tour. Say, gran’pa, may not the marriage be deferred until\\r\\n\\n\\nthe morning? It is awful to be married in solitude, on a dark, stormy\\r\\n\\n\\nnight. Say, dear gran’pa! _May_ not the marriage be put off until the\\r\\n\\n\\nmorning?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear, no; it cannot be.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—why not?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“For many reasons. For one—Anna, I confess, old soldier as I am, to a\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle superstition on some subjects. This marriage has been already put\\r\\n\\n\\noff _twice_. If it should be put off a third time, it will never take\\r\\n\\n\\nplace. A marriage thrice deferred never comes to pass. There, my child,\\r\\n\\n\\ngo and dress. It is nine o’clock. You are two hours behind time.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander is nearly ready, and the minister will be here in a few\\r\\n\\n\\nminutes,” said the old gentleman, rising and gently leading his favorite\\r\\n\\n\\nout of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘A marriage thrice deferred never comes to pass.’ I wish _I_ was sure\\r\\n\\n\\nof that, and could defer mine just _once_ more,” mused Anna, as she went\\r\\n\\n\\nback to her room. “And yet,” she added, compunctiously, “that is unjust\\r\\n\\n\\nand ungrateful to Alexander. Poor Alick! I dare say, in all these years,\\r\\n\\n\\nhe has never even dreamed of any other girl but me, while I—while I—Ah,\\r\\n\\n\\nHeaven have pity on us! Well, well, I will bury the past deep in\\r\\n\\n\\nforgetfulness, and I will try to make him a good wife.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen she reached her room she found Matty and Matty’s mother, Marcy, who\\r\\n\\n\\nwas her own old nurse, in attendance. The fire was mended, the hearth\\r\\n\\n\\nswept and the lamps lighted. The two on her dressing-table shone down\\r\\n\\n\\nupon an open casket of jewels that blazed with blinding radiance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna went wearily up to look at them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mars’ Alic sent them in by his man, honey,” said Aunt Jenny in\\r\\n\\n\\nexplanation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a splendid set of diamonds, consisting of ear-rings, breastpin,\\r\\n\\n\\nnecklace and bracelets.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You will wear them, honey, dough dere ain’t anybody to see them?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Except the giver! Yes, auntie, I will wear them. Poor Alick!” sighed\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, sitting down on her dressing-stool, and resigning herself into the\\r\\n\\n\\nhands of her attendants.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey went willingly to work. The task of arranging their mistress for\\r\\n\\n\\nher bridal was with them a labor of love.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Marcy standing behind the chair brushed and braided the beautiful\\r\\n\\n\\nhair. Young Matty on the floor, encased the dainty feet in silken hose\\r\\n\\n\\nand satin slippers. And then the beauty stood up and let them remove her\\r\\n\\n\\nwrapper and put on her robes and her wreath, and her veil. But with her\\r\\n\\n\\nown hands she clasped the diamond necklace around her throat and the\\r\\n\\n\\ndiamond bracelets on her wrists, and put ear-rings in her ears, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nbrooch upon her bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when her toilet was completed she looked, if looks were all, a very\\r\\n\\n\\nroyal bride, fit to share a young monarch’s throne.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe sat down again and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Matty, you may go and tell your master that I am ready.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl left the room to take the message, but in the hall she ran\\r\\n\\n\\nagainst some one who seemed on his way to speak to the bride. And so she\\r\\n\\n\\nturned back to say.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Miss Anna, here’s Jake asking if he can have a word with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Certainly. Tell the boy to come in,” said the young lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe son of the coachman, one of the younger grooms, entered, hat in\\r\\n\\n\\nhand, bowing low.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, my boy, what is it?” inquired his mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, Miss, I telled her as she couldn’t, and she said as she\\r\\n\\n\\n_must_, and I telled her as she shouldn’t, and she said she _would_,”\\r\\n\\n\\nreplied Jake, rather incoherently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Would?’ what?—who? I don’t understand you, boy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Her, Miss. I telled her she couldn’t, nohow, but she ’lowed she _must_,\\r\\n\\n\\nanyhow. And I telled her she shouldn’t then, there! and she ’lowed she\\r\\n\\n\\n_would_, so there!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Would what, Jake?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“See you immediate, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Who_ would see me?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Her, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who is she?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The young woman, which I think she is crazy, Miss, and not safe to be\\r\\n\\n\\nseed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, dear! dear me, Jake, what young woman are you talking of?” said\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon, impatiently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Her as runned in out’n the storm, Miss, and said how she must see you;\\r\\n\\n\\nand I telled her she wasn’t fit to be seed herself, being drippen’ wet,\\r\\n\\n\\nnor safe to be seed, being sort o’ cracked, and—oh my laws! there she is\\r\\n\\n\\nnow, a followed of me!” exclaimed the boy, breaking off in dismay, to\\r\\n\\n\\nstare with wide mouth and eyes at the opening door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon turned her head in that direction, and saw standing there a\\r\\n\\n\\nslight, pale young creature, enveloped in a long gray cloak, with its\\r\\n\\n\\nhood drawn over her head and shading her face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\n\\n              THE HOUSELESS WANDERER AND THE BRIDE ELECT.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                  They whispered—sin a shade had cast,\\r\\n\\n\\n                      Upon her youthful frame,\\r\\n\\n\\n                  And scornful murmurs as she past\\r\\n\\n\\n                      Were mingled with her name.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                  “She is not beautiful,” they said,\\r\\n\\n\\n                      I saw that she was more;\\r\\n\\n\\n                  One of those women, women dread,\\r\\n\\n\\n                      Men fatally adore.—ANON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the homeless wanderer through the wild winter-night, she who had\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled herself Anna Lyon, stood in the presence of the bride elect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla! Drusilla Sterling! Is it you? Is it really you! Oh, my poor\\r\\n\\n\\nchild, how happy I am to see you!” exclaimed Miss Lyon, in the utmost\\r\\n\\n\\nsurprise and delight, as she advanced with extended hands to welcome her\\r\\n\\n\\nunexpected guest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla suffered her cold fingers to be clasped, and she raised her\\r\\n\\n\\nsoft, appealing eyes to the young lady’s face; but she spoke no word in\\r\\n\\n\\nreply.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, my dear child, how sorrowful we have been for you! Why did you\\r\\n\\n\\nleave your home? Where have you been? What have you been doing? Where\\r\\n\\n\\ndid you come from last? And how came you out on such an awful night? And\\r\\n\\n\\noh, poor girl! in what a state you have come back? Don’t try to answer\\r\\n\\n\\nany of my questions yet! You must be warmed and fed first,” said Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon, who in her excitement had hurried question upon question to the\\r\\n\\n\\nexhausted girl, and seeing that she could not answer, repented her own\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughtless vehemence, and turning to her servants, said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Marcy, take off her cloak and hang it up, and sit her down in that\\r\\n\\n\\narm-chair before the fire, and remove her wet shoes. And, Jacob, go down\\r\\n\\n\\nstairs and ask Mrs. Dill to send up a glass of hot port wine negus, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsome warm, dry toast. And be quick about it!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJake hurried away to do his errand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the young wanderer permitted the old nurse to remove her cloak, and\\r\\n\\n\\nseat her in the chair before the fire, and take off her wet boots.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMarcy had not failed to see the fact that had also been apparent to the\\r\\n\\n\\nold woman at the toll-gate. And as she was passing out of the room with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe wet cloak over her arm, and the wet shoes in her hand, she stopped\\r\\n\\n\\nand whispered to her young mistress:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lord pity her, poor thing, I’m right down sorry for her; but she is not\\r\\n\\n\\nfit to be in your presence, Miss Anna.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor an instant the pure and high-born maiden recoiled with a look of\\r\\n\\n\\npain and horror; but then quickly recovering herself, she murmured:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush, no more of that. Take those damp things from the room and hang\\r\\n\\n\\nthem before one of the spare fires, Marcy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when the woman had gone, Miss Lyon walked up to the poor wanderer\\r\\n\\n\\nand laid her hand tenderly on her shoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe little pale face turned itself around to hers. The soft pleading\\r\\n\\n\\neyes were raised:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Lyon, that is well. Send all your women from the room, for I\\r\\n\\n\\nmust speak with you alone,” she murmured, in a voice vibrating with\\r\\n\\n\\nsuppressed anguish.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Speak to me, then, my child; and speak freely. No mother could listen\\r\\n\\n\\nto your story with more sympathy than I shall,” said the heiress,\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing a chair to the fire and sitting down near the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are not yet married? the ceremony has not yet been performed?” the\\r\\n\\n\\nwanderer inquired, looking wistfully at the bride.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, certainly not, or I should not be here; we are waiting for the\\r\\n\\n\\nminister. Did you want to see the pageantry, my child? If so, you can do\\r\\n\\n\\nso,” said the bride elect, smiling, as if to encourage her desponding\\r\\n\\n\\nprotegée.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_I_ want to see it! No, Miss Lyon, I came here to-night to put a stop\\r\\n\\n\\nto it,” exclaimed the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To put a stop to it! Drusilla, are you mad, my dear?” said Miss Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\nin amazement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I wish I was! I should have no duties to do then! Oh, Miss Lyon!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Explain yourself, my dear Drusilla; for indeed I fear some great grief\\r\\n\\n\\nhas distracted your mind.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, no; but oh, Miss Lyon, I am about to give you great pain! as great\\r\\n\\n\\nalmost as I suffer myself. Would I could suffer alone! Would I could\\r\\n\\n\\nsuffer for both!” moaned Drusilla, in a voice full of woe, as she bowed\\r\\n\\n\\nher head upon her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Speak out; speak freely,” said Miss Lyon, gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If I alone were concerned, I could be silent. If it were not to save\\r\\n\\n\\none from crime and another from misery I could be silent.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nay now, nay now, you do alarm me, Drusilla! To the point, dear child!\\r\\n\\n\\nto the point!” urged Miss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are thinking ill of me?” asked the girl, raising those meek\\r\\n\\n\\nprayerful eyes to the face of the young lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Drusilla! No one can judge you with more leniency than I shall, my\\r\\n\\n\\npoor, dear child. Do not fear to open your heart to me,” said Miss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have no cause to fear on my own account, lady. You said that you\\r\\n\\n\\nwould judge me with leniency. You meant that you would judge me with\\r\\n\\n\\ncharity. But I am not a subject of charity, Miss Lyon, I am a subject\\r\\n\\n\\nfor justice,” answered the girl, with gentle dignity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am waiting to hear your communication, Drusilla, whenever you please\\r\\n\\n\\nto tell it to me,” said Miss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut at that moment the door was opened, and Matilda entered with a tray\\r\\n\\n\\nin her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, Miss, ole Marse say how the carriage hasn’t come back\\r\\n\\n\\nlong o’ the min’ser yet, and when he comes he will send and let you\\r\\n\\n\\nknow,” the maid announced.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very well, Matilda; what have you got covered up on that tray?”\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired Miss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please, I overtook Jake, awkward fellow, tumbling up stairs with this\\r\\n\\n\\nin his hands, which he said he was ordered to fetch it up for some one\\r\\n\\n\\nas was with you, and took it away from him to fetch it myself, because\\r\\n\\n\\nif I hadn’t, he’d have fallen down and broken all the glass and spilt\\r\\n\\n\\nall the wine,” answered the girl, turning a wistful glance upon the\\r\\n\\n\\nstranger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Quite right! Put the tray on that little table, and set the table here\\r\\n\\n\\nby the fire, and leave the room,” said Miss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe maid obeyed orders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen she was gone Miss Lyon uncovered the tray, and pressed the\\r\\n\\n\\nrefreshments upon her visitor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla eagerly drank the warm wine and water, but declined the dry\\r\\n\\n\\ntoast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have so much thirst all the time, but I cannot swallow a morsel of\\r\\n\\n\\nfood, for it always chokes me!” she said, in explanation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the girl had emptied the glass, she seemed somewhat revived in\\r\\n\\n\\nstrength, and Miss Lyon again suggested that she should make the\\r\\n\\n\\ncommunication she promised.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith a deep sigh, with her head bowed upon her bosom and her hands\\r\\n\\n\\nclasped upon her knees, the girl began the story of her short life and\\r\\n\\n\\nlong sorrow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut perhaps we had better tell it for her, because, for one reason, she\\r\\n\\n\\nsuppressed much that would have vindicated herself; since to have\\r\\n\\n\\nrelated it would have criminated another. We will, with even-handed\\r\\n\\n\\njustice deal fairly by both.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER IV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                            A CHILD’S LOVE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           It is an olden story,\\r\\n\\n\\n             Yet, yet ’tis ever new,\\r\\n\\n\\n           And whensoe’er it happens,\\r\\n\\n\\n             It breaks the heart in two.\\r\\n\\n\\n                                   —FROM THE GERMAN OF UNGER.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe late Mrs. Chief Justice Lyon had been a notable manager. She had\\r\\n\\n\\nlooked well to her household, utterly scorning the idea of entrusting\\r\\n\\n\\nher domestic affairs to the hands of any hired housekeeper, until the\\r\\n\\n\\ninfirmities of age came upon her, and she could no longer rise early and\\r\\n\\n\\nsit up late, or go up and down stairs a dozen times a day, as she had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen accustomed to do.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she advertised for a housekeeper, who was required to be the\\r\\n\\n\\nnonpareil of matrons and managers, and to furnish the most\\r\\n\\n\\nunquestionable of references.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe received, in reply, just thirty-three letters from applicants for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe place. Thirty-two were read, and cast into the waste paper basket,\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout even the honor of an answer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe thirty-third was read and considered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt came from a highly respectable woman, the widow of a poor Baptist\\r\\n\\n\\nminister. Her age, her character, her competency and her references were\\r\\n\\n\\nall unexceptionable—so much so that old Mrs. Lyon seemed to think that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Lord had created the Baptist minister’s widow for the especial\\r\\n\\n\\npurpose of providing her with a housekeeper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut there was a drawback.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe widow, Mrs. Sterling, had an “encumbrance,” as a child is cruelly\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled—a little girl, aged six years, from whom she was unwilling to\\r\\n\\n\\npart. In mentioning this “item,” Mrs. Sterling had said that, if allowed\\r\\n\\n\\nto bring her child, she would consent to come at half the salary offered\\r\\n\\n\\nby Mrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old lady pondered over the letter. She was very anxious to have the\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper, but she did not want the “encumbrance.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFinally, as she could not come to any decision unaided, she took up the\\r\\n\\n\\nletter and waddled off to the old judge’s “study,” where he kept his law\\r\\n\\n\\nbooks and documents, and where he read the newspapers, and smoked or\\r\\n\\n\\ndozed the greater part of the day, but where he never “studied” for an\\r\\n\\n\\nhour.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe sat down and read the letter to him, and then said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You see she is just exactly the sort of woman that I want—and a\\r\\n\\n\\nclergyman’s widow, too—so respectable. If I were to advertise, and keep\\r\\n\\n\\non advertising for a year, I might not meet with another so suitable.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, engage her at once,” said the Chief Justice with more\\r\\n\\n\\npromptness of decision than he had often brought to bear upon his law\\r\\n\\n\\ncases.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but there’s a difficulty.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In what? Doesn’t she like the terms?—Give her her own; you can afford\\r\\n\\n\\nit, if she suits you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She likes the terms well enough. Don’t you see she offers to come at\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf what I give, if permitted to bring her child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then where on earth is the difficulty? _I_ don’t see it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, about the child, Judge.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, the little girl. Well, let the woman bring her child; what possible\\r\\n\\n\\nobjection can there be to that?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but she would be an encumbrance.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“On whom, I would like to know? Not on you, not on me, and certainly not\\r\\n\\n\\non her mother. Nonsense, my dear, let the child come; never make a\\r\\n\\n\\ndifficulty about that.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But children are so troublesome—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Especially when they are not our own. Tut, tut, if you don’t want the\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman, don’t take her; but if you do want her, take her, and let her\\r\\n\\n\\nbring her little one. Bless my soul alive, haven’t we got five or six\\r\\n\\n\\ndogs, and seven or eight cats, and half a score of birds? and if one\\r\\n\\n\\nchild can make a hundredth part of the noise that they do, I’m greatly\\r\\n\\n\\nmistaken.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but children are not like them; children are always eating cake,\\r\\n\\n\\nor sucking toffy, and toddling about with nasty, sticky hands, laying\\r\\n\\n\\nhold of your skirts—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear, don’t say mine; I don’t wear any. Nonsense, Sukey, take the\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman and risk the child. Or stay—I see light at last. Take her on trial\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the child, and then, if it should prove a nuisance, get rid of it,\\r\\n\\n\\nor of both.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That’s just what I _can_ do. Thank you, Judge, you were always a wise\\r\\n\\n\\ncounsellor,” said Mrs. Lyon, turning to leave the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t know. But hark ye, Sukey, my dear. No cutting down of the poor\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman’s salary on account of her ‘encumbrance.’ That is a reason for\\r\\n\\n\\nraising it, not for reducing it,” called the judge after his retreating\\r\\n\\n\\nwife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I never intended to give her less than full pay,” replied Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon, as she went to her room to answer her letter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe result was the engagement of Mrs. Sterling, with her “encumbrance.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe widow and her child arrived one cold day in December, soon after the\\r\\n\\n\\nfamily were settled in their town house for the winter. She was the\\r\\n\\n\\nleast in the world like the “poor widow” of poetry and fiction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was a little, wiry, muscular looking body, with no encumbrance of\\r\\n\\n\\nflesh, whatever she might have of family, for she was rather thin in\\r\\n\\n\\nform and face. She had a high color, black hair and black eyes. She was\\r\\n\\n\\ncheerful, active and enterprising. She wore no widow’s weeds, because,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe explained, it had been three years since she had lost her husband,\\r\\n\\n\\nand black was a bore, always catching dirt and showing all it caught,\\r\\n\\n\\nand making everybody gloomy. She wore serviceable browns and grays, or\\r\\n\\n\\ndark crimsons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe entered upon her duties with great energy, and soon had the house in\\r\\n\\n\\nperfect order, and the domestic machinery moving like magic. It is\\r\\n\\n\\nneedless to say that she gave great satisfaction to her employers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do not know how I ever got along without her. I know I could not\\r\\n\\n\\nnow,” said Mrs. Lyon, adding, “I would rather have her, even with two\\r\\n\\n\\nchildren instead of one, than any body else without any. And indeed the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild is _not_ a nuisance, after all.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNo, the child was not a nuisance. And neither did she bear the slightest\\r\\n\\n\\nresemblance to her mother. She was a delicate little creature, with a\\r\\n\\n\\npure, pale face; large, soft, gray eyes, and bright, silky, brown hair.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was very quiet, thoughtful and industrious for such a mere infant.\\r\\n\\n\\nHer mother ruled her with the same rigid discipline with which she\\r\\n\\n\\ngoverned all the servants of the household committed to her charge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe little one was never allowed to go out of doors except on Sunday,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen she was taken by her mother to church, or sent by herself to Sunday\\r\\n\\n\\nschool. On all other days she was confined strictly to the housekeeper’s\\r\\n\\n\\nroom, where, after learning one lesson, doing one sum, and writing one\\r\\n\\n\\ncopy, she was kept stitching patch-work quilts from morning till night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Chief Justice, who was an awful myth to the little girl, had never\\r\\n\\n\\nonce set eyes on her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut old Mrs. Lyon, coming occasionally to the housekeeper’s room to give\\r\\n\\n\\nsome orders, would see the demure little creature sitting on her low\\r\\n\\n\\nstool in the corner of the hearth, and stitching soberly at her\\r\\n\\n\\npatch-work, and she would say to the mother:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Sterling, why don’t you let that child run out into the garden and\\r\\n\\n\\nplay in this fine, clear, frosty weather? The air would do her good.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know, madam. You see how delicate she is; she might take\\r\\n\\n\\ncold.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Delicate, and no wonder, Mrs. Sterling; kept mewed up in this close\\r\\n\\n\\nroom at needle-work all the time, as if she was sewing for her living—a\\r\\n\\n\\nbabe of six years old! If you are afraid to let her go into the garden,\\r\\n\\n\\nlet her run about the house; don’t keep her here always.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, madam; but I cannot let her do so. She might grow\\r\\n\\n\\ntroublesome; and, besides, she _will_ have to sew for a living some day\\r\\n\\n\\nor other if she doesn’t do it now. She can’t have me always to look to;\\r\\n\\n\\nshe will have to take care of herself, and so she must learn to be\\r\\n\\n\\npatient and industrious by times.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor little thing,” murmured the old lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t pity her, if you please, madam, or put into her head that she is\\r\\n\\n\\nill-used, for she isn’t. I do everything for her good, and it’s not\\r\\n\\n\\nlikely that I would do any thing else, for I am her own mother,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nthe housekeeper, respectfully but firmly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t believe you know what is for her good, and if you are her own\\r\\n\\n\\nmother you treat her worse than any stepmother would,” the old lady\\r\\n\\n\\nthought and would have said, only that she was a little afraid of Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She isn’t the least like you. Who is she like?” inquired Miss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Her father. See, here is his miniature,” said the widow, drawing from\\r\\n\\n\\nher pocket a morocco case, and handing it to the old lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, she is like her father. What a very interesting face he has. Has\\r\\n\\n\\nhe been dead long?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Three years last March; he died of consumption. I suppose she will go\\r\\n\\n\\nthe same way,” said the widow, indicating her child.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You should not let her hear you say so; if she gets the impression that\\r\\n\\n\\nshe is to die of consumption because her father did she will probably do\\r\\n\\n\\nso,” whispered Mrs. Lyon. Then aloud she spoke this truth: “Nobody need\\r\\n\\n\\ndie of consumption or of anything else except old age, unless they have\\r\\n\\n\\na mind to. Plenty of good food and proper clothing, and out-door\\r\\n\\n\\nexercise will prevent consumption.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd with a parting glance of pity at the pale child, the old lady left\\r\\n\\n\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You mustn’t mind what Mrs. Lyon says; she is not like us. She is a\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat lady, and thinks of nothing but taking her ease and indulging\\r\\n\\n\\nherself, and she fancies that _we_ can do the same; but you know we\\r\\n\\n\\ncan’t,” said the widow, applying the antidote to what she considered the\\r\\n\\n\\npoison that had been dropped into the child’s mind. “We must deny\\r\\n\\n\\nourselves, and bear our burden, and after all it is easy enough to do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said the mite in the corner, repeating her Sunday school\\r\\n\\n\\nScripture text, for our Saviour said, ‘Whosoever will come after me let\\r\\n\\n\\nhim deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.’\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, and if you don’t do it you know you will be eternally lost,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nthe clergyman’s widow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, but our Saviour will never let me be lost, no never; I know that\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How do you know that? If you disobey him you will be lost.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no! He will not let me be—no, never, not even if I was to steal\\r\\n\\n\\naway from my work and go and play in the garden. He would forgive me\\r\\n\\n\\nlike he did Peter; and then I should feel sorry, and cry, and then he\\r\\n\\n\\nwould make it all right again,” said the quaint little infant Theologian\\r\\n\\n\\nwith an air of positive conviction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Child! where did you learn such bad doctrines? Not at Sunday school, I\\r\\n\\n\\nknow,” said the widow, in dismay.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I did, in the Sunday school, in the Bible texts, and they are\\r\\n\\n\\ngood. Our Saviour was good and all that he did was good. Don’t he say\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he was sent to seek and to save them that were _lost_? And I know\\r\\n\\n\\nhe will never let me be lost, no nor the old lady neither, even if she\\r\\n\\n\\ndoes take her ease, because she is so good-hearted.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Miss! don’t you know it is wrong to contradict your mother? And you\\r\\n\\n\\nhave contradicted me several times.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I know—but—I must say what is true about Our Saviour when we talk\\r\\n\\n\\nof him.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, you shall sew one hour longer this evening, as a punishment for\\r\\n\\n\\nyour disrespect to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, mamma, I will sew all day and all night, if that will do you any\\r\\n\\n\\ngood, so you will let me say what is true about Our Saviour. Sewing is\\r\\n\\n\\neasy enough, the dear knows—easier than being scourged and stoned, and\\r\\n\\n\\nall that, like some of his poor friends were for his sake,” said the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild, as she carefully fitted the little squares of her patch-work\\r\\n\\n\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Only six years old and to talk like that! She is one of the children\\r\\n\\n\\nwho are doomed to die early,” thought Mrs. Sterling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd indeed any one looking at that child, with her delicate frame, large\\r\\n\\n\\nbrain and active intellect, must have come to the same conclusion. But\\r\\n\\n\\nthey would every one have been mistaken. There was a wonderful vitality\\r\\n\\n\\nand power of endurance in that little slight nervous frame. No one is\\r\\n\\n\\nfaultless. And if this little atom had a fault, it was that of being\\r\\n\\n\\njust a “wee bit” self-opinionated. She was a very promising pupil in a\\r\\n\\n\\nvery orthodox Sunday school; yet from the very texts they had taught her\\r\\n\\n\\nshe had received impressions that the teachers certainly never had\\r\\n\\n\\nintended to give her, and these impressions had become convictions in\\r\\n\\n\\ndefence of which she was willing at six years to suffer the baby\\r\\n\\n\\nmartyrdom of—“sewing all day and all night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile the Christmas Holidays were approaching, and the young son of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house was coming home to spend them. And his uncle and cousin were\\r\\n\\n\\ninvited to meet him. Great preparations were made to entertain the\\r\\n\\n\\nparty. Old Mrs. Lyon’s visits to the housekeeper’s room became more and\\r\\n\\n\\nmore frequent as the time for the arrival of the visitors drew near.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd whenever the old lady came, she inevitably found the quiet child\\r\\n\\n\\nsitting on her stool in the corner of the hearth sewing for dear life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut old Mrs. Lyon took no farther notice of the infant. Partly because\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was too full of her own affairs and partly because she was\\r\\n\\n\\ndispleased by the housekeeper’s disregard of her advice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the demure child, listening to every word that passed, with the\\r\\n\\n\\ninterest only a recluse could feel, heard a great deal about “Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander.” Whoever else might be coming, it was for this darling only\\r\\n\\n\\nson that his mother planned. It was of his comfort and pleasure only\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she thought and talked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the little listening child grew to look upon “Mr. Alexander” as some\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung king of Israel—some splendid and magnificent Saul, or Solomon, who\\r\\n\\n\\nwas to be the glory of the house. And because hero-worshipping was a\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessity of her deep, earnest, reverent soul, she began to worship him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length, two or three days before Christmas, the expected visitors\\r\\n\\n\\nbegan to arrive.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFirst came General Lyon, the fine, martial-looking old man with his\\r\\n\\n\\ncommanding form and snow white hair and beard; and his grand-daughter,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe beautiful Anna Lyon, then a fair, blooming, blue-eyed and\\r\\n\\n\\ngolden-haired hoyden of twelve years of age; both attended by their\\r\\n\\n\\nservants. And next came Mr. Alexander, then a rollicking young man of\\r\\n\\n\\neighteen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe whole party was assembled in the drawing-room, and Mrs. Sterling\\r\\n\\n\\nhappened to be with them when Mr. Alexander was announced and entered,\\r\\n\\n\\nin a great noisy bustle of joy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe shook hands heartily with his father and then with his uncle; and he\\r\\n\\n\\nembraced his mother and his cousin, and then, before he knew what he was\\r\\n\\n\\nabout, he threw his arms around the housekeeper and hugged and kissed\\r\\n\\n\\nher.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, see here! you know I didn’t mean it, I didn’t indeed, ma’am; I beg\\r\\n\\n\\nten thousand pardons! but I am so much in the habit of kissing everybody\\r\\n\\n\\nI meet here that—that—I kissed you by mistake. But if you don’t mind it,\\r\\n\\n\\n_I_ don’t; or if you feel aggrieved, why, you may kiss and hug _me_, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthat will make it all square between us,” laughed the boy, when he\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovered his error.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe clergyman’s widow curtsied very stiffly without moving a muscle of\\r\\n\\n\\nher face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This is Mrs. Sterling, who manages our house, Alick,” said his mother,\\r\\n\\n\\ngravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Sterling, I am very happy to have the honor of knowing you, and I\\r\\n\\n\\nam persuaded that the house is managed to perfection,” said the young\\r\\n\\n\\nman, bowing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe widow curtsied more stiffly than before, and then withdrew from the\\r\\n\\n\\nroom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I say, Anna, I wouldn’t kiss her again for the best hunter in your\\r\\n\\n\\nfather’s stables; my lips got frost-bitten by that first encounter,”\\r\\n\\n\\nwhispered the young man, with a smile, to his cousin.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Served you right, Alick. You should look before you leap,” laughed\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That mightn’t always prevent my leaping, especially if the feat seemed\\r\\n\\n\\na dangerous one, though it would have done so in this case, I admit.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the arrival of another guest—an uninvited and\\r\\n\\n\\nunexpected, if not an unwelcome one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe door was opened by a servant, who grimly announced:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Richard Hammond.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd “Poor Dick,” the black sheep of the flock, entered the room, looking\\r\\n\\n\\nrather sheepish, it must be confessed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd yet he was a very handsome and gentlemanly youth, tall, slender,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith a fine Grecian profile, with a clear brown complexion, black\\r\\n\\n\\ncurling hair and dark changing eyes—with a frank countenance and an\\r\\n\\n\\nengaging smile that few, or none, could resist.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut well he might look sheepish, poor outlawed fellow, for his entrance\\r\\n\\n\\ncast an instantaneous chill over the family circle.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon drew himself up haughtily. The chief justice looked grave,\\r\\n\\n\\nhis wife sad, and their son angry. Only Anna seemed pleased. And not\\r\\n\\n\\nonly pleased, but delighted. For the instant she saw him she bounced up,\\r\\n\\n\\noverturning two or three chairs in her hurry and rushed to meet him,\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaiming:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Cousin Dick! Oh, dear Cousin Dick, I am so glad you’ve come! It would\\r\\n\\n\\nhave been such a dull Christmas, indeed no Christmas at all, without\\r\\n\\n\\nyou!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she gave him both her hands and pressed and shook his, and drew him\\r\\n\\n\\ntowards the group, and first instinctively presented him to the\\r\\n\\n\\nkind-hearted old lady:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Aunt Lyon, here is Cousin Dick. Are you not very glad to see him?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How do you do, Richard?” said the old lady, offering her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the black sheep stooped and kissed her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Uncle, here’s Dick. Isn’t it a pleasant surprise?” asked Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd uncle had to come and shake the scape-grace by the hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Grandpa, look here; you don’t see Dick. Here’s Dick waiting to speak to\\r\\n\\n\\nyou!” she persisted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd General Lyon had to turn and meet the engaging smile of the handsome\\r\\n\\n\\nboy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick,” said Anna, in a low whisper, giving her betrothed a sharp dig\\r\\n\\n\\nin the ribs with her elbow, and a very vicious look from her angry blue\\r\\n\\n\\neyes, “if you don’t stop glowering, and come and speak to Dick, I’ll\\r\\n\\n\\nnever speak to _you_ again.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anything to keep peace in the family,” laughed Mr. Alexander, as he\\r\\n\\n\\ncleared up his brow, and went and welcomed the new comer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in two minutes more Dick was seated in the circle around the fire,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe life of the little company talking and laughing, telling jokes and\\r\\n\\n\\nsinging songs, and keeping everybody pleased and amused, so that they\\r\\n\\n\\nforgot they did not want him, and almost fancied that they could not do\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was nothing very wrong about Dick Hammond. It is true that he was\\r\\n\\n\\na very unpromising law student, being rather idle and extravagant—fonder\\r\\n\\n\\nof play than of work, and loving his “friends” better than himself. You\\r\\n\\n\\nknow the sort of man—one of that sort of whom it is always said that he\\r\\n\\n\\nis “nobody’s enemy but his own.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick had a neat little patrimony, but his relations said that he was in\\r\\n\\n\\na fair way of making “ducks and drakes” of it, and they discountenanced\\r\\n\\n\\nand disapproved of him accordingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis one fast friend was his cousin Anna, and every year she was growing\\r\\n\\n\\nto be a stronger and more important one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt ten o’clock that night, Mr. Richard Hammond made a motion to go, but\\r\\n\\n\\nthe chief justice said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stay all night, Dick.” And old Mrs. Lyon added:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stay and spend the Christmas holidays with us, Dick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo Mr. Richard stayed, and sent for his portmanteau from the hotel where\\r\\n\\n\\nhe had stopped on his first coming to the city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd having the freedom of the house, he took more liberties in it than\\r\\n\\n\\nany one else would dare to do—going into any part of it, and at any hour\\r\\n\\n\\nhe pleased; popping in and out of the chief justice’s secluded study,\\r\\n\\n\\nand breaking up his naps; popping in and out of the old lady’s sacred\\r\\n\\n\\ndressing-room, and startling her in the midst of the mysterious rites of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe toilet; and bouncing in and out of the housekeeper’s room, the\\r\\n\\n\\npantry or the kitchen, to the serious discomfiture of the manager, the\\r\\n\\n\\nbutler and the cook.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYet everybody loved Dick, so long as the influence of his frank manners,\\r\\n\\n\\nsunny smile, and sweet voice was upon them. But when that was withdrawn,\\r\\n\\n\\nand they were left to their sober reason, they strongly disapproved of\\r\\n\\n\\nhim.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Little pitchers have long ears and wide mouths,” says the proverb. And\\r\\n\\n\\nthe little pitcher in Mrs. Sterling’s private apartment was no exception\\r\\n\\n\\nto the general rule. Sitting stitching at her patch-work, she often\\r\\n\\n\\nheard Mr. Richard’s shortcomings discussed, and she pitied him, for she\\r\\n\\n\\nthought that he had wandered away very far from the fold, and was in a\\r\\n\\n\\nvery bad way indeed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOne day when poor Dick popped into the housekeeper’s room, to ask for\\r\\n\\n\\nsome brandy and salt to dip the wick of his candles in, to make “corpse\\r\\n\\n\\nlights” for ghosts to carry, and scare the maids with, he found no one\\r\\n\\n\\nthere but the child, sitting in the corner and stitching patch-work as\\r\\n\\n\\nusual.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked up at him solemnly, and nearly annihilated him with the\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowing appalling question:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Young man, are you one of the lost sheep of the House of Israel?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“EH?” exclaimed Dick, starting.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I ask you, are you a lost sheep? They say you are a black sheep, and I\\r\\n\\n\\nbelieve it is the black sheep that go astray,” she said, gravely, and\\r\\n\\n\\nfolding her hands and contemplating him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick burst out laughing, but when he recovered himself he answered very\\r\\n\\n\\ngravely:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, I fear I am a lost sheep, little girl.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, that is bad, but don’t be frightened. Our Saviour knows where you\\r\\n\\n\\nare, and He will be sure to find you, and fetch you into the fold.\\r\\n\\n\\nBecause, you know, He came to seek and to save those that are lost. And\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat he came to do He _will_ do, and nothing in this world can prevent\\r\\n\\n\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’ll be shot if that isn’t an encouraging doctrine if it is a true one,\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle girl. I sometimes wish somebody _would_ find me and fetch me into\\r\\n\\n\\na place of safety; but I fear I shouldn’t be worth keeping when found,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor I am a sad, foolish, naughty sheep, child,” said the young man, with\\r\\n\\n\\na self-mocking laugh.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Never mind, don’t make game of yourself. If our Saviour thinks you\\r\\n\\n\\nworth looking for you are too good to be laughed at; and when He does\\r\\n\\n\\nfind you and fetch you into the fold, He will make as good a sheep of\\r\\n\\n\\nyou as—as—as—” The child seemed at a loss for a comparison, until her\\r\\n\\n\\nface suddenly lighted up, and she said: “As Mr. Alexander himself!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As Mr. Alexander himself! Oh, my eye! catch me, somebody! Only there’s\\r\\n\\n\\nnobody to do it!” said Dick, rolling up against the wall and holding his\\r\\n\\n\\nsides.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What’s the matter? Have you got the stomach-ache? There’s some rum and\\r\\n\\n\\nmolasses in the cupboard,” said the child.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, oh no!” cried Dick, bursting into vociferous laughter. “You are the\\r\\n\\n\\nsolemnest little quiz! To hold up Mr. Alexander as a model for me! Well!\\r\\n\\n\\nI’m bad enough, goodness knows, but—! Why, little one, Mr. Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nisn’t a sheep at all, either good or bad! He’s a goat, a rank black\\r\\n\\n\\ngoat, and never has been in the fold, and never would be let into it!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, it is very wrong in you to speak ill of a gentleman so in his\\r\\n\\n\\nabsence,” gravely asserted the little monitor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So it is; you are right there, little girl,” admitted the scape-grace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the timely entrance of Mrs. Sterling put an end to this strange\\r\\n\\n\\ninterview, and possibly saved the young man a serious lecture from the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle child.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick got his candles, brandy and salt, and whatever else he wanted of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe housekeeper; for that strong-minded woman, no more than her weaker\\r\\n\\n\\nsisters and brethren, could resist Dick’s irresistible smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER V\\r\\n\\n\\n                       THE CHILD MEETS HER FATE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                “The sun himself is coming up this way.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThat night “a most horrid spectre,” wrapped in a long winding sheet, and\\r\\n\\n\\nbearing a corpse candle that cast a cadaverous color over his\\r\\n\\n\\ncountenance, stalked through the lower regions of the house, frightening\\r\\n\\n\\nthe maids, and the men too, for that matter, from their propriety, and\\r\\n\\n\\nraising such a row in the dignified residence of the chief justice as\\r\\n\\n\\nmight have brought the police down upon any house of a less assured\\r\\n\\n\\nstanding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd upon an investigation of the matter next morning, Mr. Richard was\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovered to be at the bottom of the business.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the quiet little girl in the housekeeper’s room heard again of his\\r\\n\\n\\ndelinquencies and pitied him and wished that he was more like Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, that splendid paragon of youth whom his mother was always\\r\\n\\n\\npraising. The child, closely confined to her mother’s chamber, had never\\r\\n\\n\\nseen the hero of her admiration. But the hour was near at hand when she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas to meet him in an interview destined to determine the whole course\\r\\n\\n\\nof her future life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was on Christmas Eve. All the preparations for the Christmas festival\\r\\n\\n\\nwere made. The turkeys were already killed and dressed for the roaster;\\r\\n\\n\\nthe hams were in soak; the plum pudding was mixed; the pies and cakes\\r\\n\\n\\nbaked; and all the materials for the egg-nogg and apple-toddy laid out\\r\\n\\n\\non the pantry table; and the notable housekeeper might have taken her\\r\\n\\n\\nease but for one thing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was to be a pantomime at the city theatres that evening. And the\\r\\n\\n\\nthree young people were to go. And as there were no reserved seats, they\\r\\n\\n\\nwere to go very early in order to secure good places, for it was\\r\\n\\n\\nforeseen that the house would be very much crowded. And thus dinner was\\r\\n\\n\\nordered two hours earlier than usual, so that they might get off in\\r\\n\\n\\ntime.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sterling, having finished her morning’s work, was putting off her\\r\\n\\n\\nworking gown of brown alpacca to put on a nice dress of black silk in\\r\\n\\n\\nhonor of Christmas Eve, when old Mrs. Lyon came in to give the\\r\\n\\n\\ninstructions about the dinner, and having given them, immediately left\\r\\n\\n\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe housekeeper was in no plight to go all the way down to the kitchen,\\r\\n\\n\\nso she sent the child to tell the cook to come up to her for orders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe little one went and delivered her message faithfully; and was\\r\\n\\n\\nreturning to her mother’s room, when, in passing through the back hall,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe suddenly met the god of her infant idolatry face to face. She knew\\r\\n\\n\\nhim at once, either by instinct or because there was no other young man\\r\\n\\n\\nbeside Mr. Richard (whom she knew by sight) in the house. She backed up\\r\\n\\n\\ninto a corner to let him pass.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Heyday! Who have we here? A child in the house? I haven’t seen such a\\r\\n\\n\\nthing here for years! Or are you a fairy changling?” inquired Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe child did not reply, but—I am sorry to say—put her finger in her\\r\\n\\n\\nmouth, dropped her chin and rolled up her eyes in a shy glance at the\\r\\n\\n\\nsplendid youth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah bah! that’s very nasty! Don’t stick your finger in your mouth and\\r\\n\\n\\nstare, but hold up your head and answer when you are spoken to. Tell me\\r\\n\\n\\nwho you are, little girl!” said Mr. Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPrince Solomon had condescended to issue orders and they were\\r\\n\\n\\nimmediately obeyed by his loyal subject. Down went the little finger; up\\r\\n\\n\\nwent the little face, and she answered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am Mrs. Sterling’s little girl.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And a very nice little girl, too, to do as you are bid. Always do so,\\r\\n\\n\\ndo you hear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And so you are the housekeeper’s daughter?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How is it that I haven’t seen anything of you before?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because mother never lets me go out of her room.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Never lets you go out of her room?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because she is afraid that the——” Here the child lowered her voice to a\\r\\n\\n\\ntone of mysterious awe—“_chief justice_ would be angry if he saw me\\r\\n\\n\\nabout.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bosh about his being angry! He is not a King Herod to hate the sight of\\r\\n\\n\\na child, or desire the death of the innocents. You don’t mean to tell me\\r\\n\\n\\nthat you are cooped up in the housekeeper’s room all the time?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh no, sir, I am not cooped up anywhere any of the time; only the\\r\\n\\n\\npoultry for Christmas was cooped up, and that was in the back yard; I\\r\\n\\n\\nsaw them through the window. But I sit on a nice little stool in\\r\\n\\n\\nmother’s room and sew pretty quilt pieces.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All day long?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And every day?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir, not every day. I go to Sunday school on Sundays.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But on all other days you are kept confined to that room all day long?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, you look just as if you were, you poor little pale thing, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthat is the truth. It is horrid. I’ll speak to my mother about it. Why,\\r\\n\\n\\nyou ought to be romping all over the house, you know, and going to\\r\\n\\n\\npantomimes o’ Christmas, like other children. Say, little a—a—What is\\r\\n\\n\\nyour name?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anna Drusilla Sterling, sir,” said the child, beginning to grow restive\\r\\n\\n\\nunder all this questioning, and to swing her shoulders from side to\\r\\n\\n\\nside, after the manner of some children when saying their lessons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There—don’t do that; it’s ugly,” said Mr. Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the swinging instantly ceased.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Anna Drusilla Sterling?’ Well, I have one Anna already, so I shall\\r\\n\\n\\ncall you Drusilla,” said the young man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But my mother calls me Anny.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Never mind what your mother calls you—I shall call you Drusilla. Well,\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle Drusilla, wouldn’t you like to go to the pantomime with us\\r\\n\\n\\nto-night?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir. Please, what is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is something got up to amuse little children like you, though big\\r\\n\\n\\nchildren like myself find it equally diverting. Wouldn’t you like to go?\\r\\n\\n\\nI should like to take you, and to see it through your great staring\\r\\n\\n\\neyes, as well as through my own. It would be a ‘new sensation.’ Come,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat do you say?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, sir. Is it pretty?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beautiful!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And good!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is heavenly!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I think I should like to go, sir, if mother will let me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, she will let you fast enough, for I shall make a point of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What did you call it, sir, please?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A pantomime.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I know now,” said the child, with a sudden look of bright\\r\\n\\n\\nintelligence; “it is something about Moses and the children of Israel,\\r\\n\\n\\nisn’t it, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh? ‘Moses and the children of Israel?’ What put that into your little\\r\\n\\n\\nnoddle?” laughed the young man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, sir, you know the books of Moses are called the\\r\\n\\n\\npanta—panta—something; it’s a very hard word, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you are talking of the pentateuch?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir, a very hard word. I always miss it at the class, it is so\\r\\n\\n\\nvery hard.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very,” laughed the young man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd now, as the voice of the housekeeper was heard calling her child,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe little girl made her Sunday school curtsey, and ran away from her\\r\\n\\n\\nnew friend to join her mother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander gazed after her as he might if she had been sixteen\\r\\n\\n\\ninstead of six, for he was fond of children, as well as of kittens and\\r\\n\\n\\npuppies, and all small creatures. They amused him. He was now determined\\r\\n\\n\\nthat this quaint little child should go to the pantomime with himself\\r\\n\\n\\nand his friends, for he knew perfectly well that to watch _her_, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwitness _her_ wonder and delight, would be as diverting as to see the\\r\\n\\n\\nplay itself—it would, in that way double his own entertainment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alick was benevolent, but not very scrupulous, I regret to confess.\\r\\n\\n\\nSo, when he went to the housekeeper’s room to ask leave to take the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild to the pantomime, judging that the Baptist preacher’s widow would\\r\\n\\n\\nset her face against all such exhibitions, he took a hint from the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild’s mistake, and was so unprincipled as to persuade that pious\\r\\n\\n\\nmatron that the spectacle in question was a historical affair,\\r\\n\\n\\nillustrative of the Israelites, and very instructive and edifying to the\\r\\n\\n\\nyouthful mind. And so, with Mr. Richard to back him he talked the\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper into consenting that her child should accompany them,\\r\\n\\n\\nespecially as Miss Anna was to be one of the party. And Mrs. Sterling\\r\\n\\n\\nbegan to dress little Drusilla—we shall call the child by her second\\r\\n\\n\\nname, for the same reason that Mr. Alexander did, to distinguish her\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom the other Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nImmediately after dinner the young party set out, and reached the\\r\\n\\n\\ntheatre in time to get good front seats.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe pantomime was “Jack the Giant Killer.” But as Mr. Alexander kept\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle Drusilla beside himself, and kept the play bill in his own hands,\\r\\n\\n\\nhe found it easy to persuade the simple child that the exhibition was of\\r\\n\\n\\n“David and Goliath,” Jack was David, and Jack’s first giant was Goliath.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the child was exceedingly edified, as well as highly entertained.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander found it “as good as a play,” and much better than a\\r\\n\\n\\npantomime, to watch her. Her credulity was equal to her delight, and\\r\\n\\n\\nboth were unbounded. But she thought it was not exactly like the\\r\\n\\n\\nScripture story, after all.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander explained to her that they could not make it exactly like,\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause things were so different now to what they were then.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla accepted the explanation in full faith, saying in her\\r\\n\\n\\nsolemn way, that she supposed they did the best they could, and that we\\r\\n\\n\\nmust “take the will for the deed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe pantomime was over a little after ten o’clock, and the youthful\\r\\n\\n\\nparty returned home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla, restored to her mother’s charge, would have rehearsed\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her benefit all the great spectacle of “David and Goliath,” but that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe good lady told her that it was time for her to be asleep, and made\\r\\n\\n\\nher go immediately to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNotwithstanding the late hour at which the young people had retired on\\r\\n\\n\\nChristmas Eve, they were all up by times on Christmas day. All was\\r\\n\\n\\nlively bustle throughout the house. Everybody had Christmas gifts, at\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich each pretended to be as much surprised as he or she was expected\\r\\n\\n\\nto be.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Anna had a little set of diamonds, consisting of ear-rings and\\r\\n\\n\\nbrooch, presented by her grandfather; an ermine tippet and muff from her\\r\\n\\n\\nuncle; a set of antique lace from her aunt; a diamond bracelet from her\\r\\n\\n\\nbetrothed; and from scape-grace Dick a real King Charles lap-dog, which\\r\\n\\n\\nshe openly preferred to all her other presents, because she said it was\\r\\n\\n\\nalive, and could give love for love.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old lady had a new patent easy chair, a new pair of gold spectacles,\\r\\n\\n\\nand a set of sables.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the gentlemen of the party were overwhelmed with embroidered\\r\\n\\n\\nslippers, smoking-caps, dressing-gowns, penwipers, and so forth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe housekeeper was presented with a new brown silk dress. And there was\\r\\n\\n\\nnot a servant in the house but received a present.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And who has got anything for little Drusilla?” inquired Mr. Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut nobody answered him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I’m dashed! Only one bit of a baby in the house, and nobody has\\r\\n\\n\\nthought of her. And this especially a child’s festival, because it\\r\\n\\n\\ncelebrates the birth of the Divine Child, who also loved little\\r\\n\\n\\nchildren! Say, mother, the shops are open in the city this morning, are\\r\\n\\n\\nthey not?” inquired Mr. Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Until ten o’clock, Alick; not after,” replied the old lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right, it is only eight now—plenty of time. I’m off; but I’ll be\\r\\n\\n\\nback to breakfast,” said Mr. Alexander, darting out of the drawing-room,\\r\\n\\n\\nseizing his hat in the hall, and rushing from the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, what a kind heart has this child of our old age, John!” said the\\r\\n\\n\\nold lady, turning proudly and fondly to her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes—yes; a good boy—a good boy,” answered the Chief Justice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Anna, my dear, you will be a happy woman if you live long enough,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor you will have a good husband,” she continued, turning to her\\r\\n\\n\\nintended daughter-in-law.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna shrugged her shoulders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You don’t seem to agree with me, Anna.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes I do, Aunt Lyon, to some extent. I think Alick is really very\\r\\n\\n\\nkind when it amuses him; but I don’t think he would be kind to any\\r\\n\\n\\nliving creature when it would bore him to be so. For instance, he would\\r\\n\\n\\nbring me home a present, and be really delighted with my delight in it;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut he wouldn’t give up a skating party to take me to a wax-work show if\\r\\n\\n\\nI were to cry myself ill from disappointment.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I suppose you have had a tiff with him; that’s of no consequence at\\r\\n\\n\\nall. ‘The quarrel of lovers is the renewal of love,’” said the old lady,\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughing to herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Anna had had no tiff with her betrothed, and her judgment of him was\\r\\n\\n\\na righteous one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alick soon came rushing in with his arms full of packages, and\\r\\n\\n\\nlooking like a railway porter. He set down three large ones on the\\r\\n\\n\\nfloor, threw himself into a chair, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now then, mother, send for little Drusilla. It will be fun to watch her\\r\\n\\n\\neyes when she sees these things.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon rang the bell, and sent a servant to fetch the little girl to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe child’s mother being in a particularly good humor since receiving\\r\\n\\n\\nthe new brown silk dress, made no objection, but sent her along in\\r\\n\\n\\ncharge of the servant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla entered the drawing-room, looking very pretty in her new\\r\\n\\n\\nred merino frock, which suited well with her dark hair and dark eyes,\\r\\n\\n\\nand clear, pale face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe made her little curtsy at the door, and then as Mr. Alexander held\\r\\n\\n\\nout his arms she ran straight up to him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, then,” said the young gentleman, taking her on his knee, while the\\r\\n\\n\\nmysterious packages lay all around his feet, “if you could have your\\r\\n\\n\\nwish, what would you wish for?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mother says it is foolish and wicked to wish for anything, because if\\r\\n\\n\\nit is for our good, the Lord will give it to us whether or not.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well but suppose you were so foolish and wicked as to wish for\\r\\n\\n\\nanything, what would it be?” persisted the young man, while all the\\r\\n\\n\\nother members of the Christmas party looked on, smilingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe child pondered gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come—what would it be?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think a work-box,” answered the child, looking up at length.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What! not a doll-baby?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I would rather have a doll-baby, but I thought it would be _too_\\r\\n\\n\\nwicked to wish for that, because it is useless,” said the little one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, look here, now! First, here’s the doll-baby,” said Mr. Alick,\\r\\n\\n\\nunwrapping one of the parcels, and taking from a mass of tissue paper a\\r\\n\\n\\nsplendid wax doll, with rosy cheeks, blue eyes and golden hair, all\\r\\n\\n\\ndressed in blue satin and white lace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh-h-h! m-y-y!” exclaimed the child, in breathless delight, as she took\\r\\n\\n\\nthe doll and held it up before her, and gazed at it with ever-widening\\r\\n\\n\\neyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander laughed and squeezed her, he so much enjoyed her\\r\\n\\n\\nenjoyment, and the whole party looked on, amused and interested.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Isn’t it a beauty?” asked the youth, giving the child another squeeze.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is a love! it is a darling! it is as pretty as—as—as Miss Anna!” she\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed, turning her eyes from the golden-haired doll to the\\r\\n\\n\\ngolden-haired girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, little one! That compliment is sincere, however flattering,”\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed the heiress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now look here!” said Mr. Alexander, taking up another parcel; “she\\r\\n\\n\\nis wearing her ball dress, you know, which is very proper for Christmas,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut would never do for every day. And a thrifty little woman like you\\r\\n\\n\\nwould never let her doll wear her best clothes for common; so you must\\r\\n\\n\\nfit her out with a wardrobe, and here are the goods to do it with.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he unrolled a second parcel, and displayed a yard each of pink, blue\\r\\n\\n\\nand buff cambric, and several yards of white muslin, and some remnants\\r\\n\\n\\nof ribbon and lace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now,” he said, as the child was contemplating these additional\\r\\n\\n\\ntreasures with increased delight, “now you will require something to\\r\\n\\n\\nmake them up with, won’t you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no; I mustn’t wish for anything more. This is too much!” said the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle one, with eyes dancing for joy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Except what you wished for first of all, which I think was something\\r\\n\\n\\nlike this,” said Mr. Alexander opening a third parcel, and producing a\\r\\n\\n\\npretty little work-box fitted out with scissors, thimble, needles,\\r\\n\\n\\nthread, and every requisite for sewing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, how much I do thank you, sir. Once before I dreamt I had pretty\\r\\n\\n\\nthings like these all to myself, and I was sorry I ever woke up. Do you\\r\\n\\n\\nthink I’ll wake up this time, sir?” inquired the little girl, evidently\\r\\n\\n\\nperplexed between delight and dismay.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander laughed, and intensely enjoyed the pastime that he had\\r\\n\\n\\npurchased at so small an outlay, but the old lady said, very gravely:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have bewildered the child, Alick. She is not used to presents, and\\r\\n\\n\\nyou should have treated her upon the same principle as that upon which\\r\\n\\n\\nthe doctors treat their patients, who have been suffering from a long\\r\\n\\n\\nstarvation, and given her but a little at a time. And now put her off\\r\\n\\n\\nyour knee and come to breakfast; or if you can’t part with her, bring\\r\\n\\n\\nher along.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander immediately put the little creature down, and told her to\\r\\n\\n\\ntake up her treasures and run away with them to her mother as fast as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe could.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander could give the child presents and divert himself with her\\r\\n\\n\\ndelight in them, but he could not consent to be bothered with her at the\\r\\n\\n\\nbreakfast table, where he wished to give “his whole mind” to the\\r\\n\\n\\nbusiness there to be on hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis mother, more considerate, touched the bell, and told the servant who\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered it to help the child to carry her presents to the housekeeper’s\\r\\n\\n\\nroom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe man gathered the parcels up and took Drusilla by the hand; but as he\\r\\n\\n\\nled her from the room she suddenly looked back, impulsively broke away\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom her guard, and ran up to her benefactor and took his hand and\\r\\n\\n\\nkissed it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, what a grateful little imp you are, to be sure! It is worth while\\r\\n\\n\\ntrying to please _you_; one succeeds so well and one’s efforts are\\r\\n\\n\\nappreciated and thanked,” said the young man, raising the child in his\\r\\n\\n\\narms and kissing her, and then darting a half-merry, half-reproachful\\r\\n\\n\\nglance at his cousin Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you meant that for _me_, Mr. Alick, I don’t see the point of it. You\\r\\n\\n\\nnever do anything to please _me_, unless it still better pleases\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself. You are one of the sort of folk who would carelessly fling a\\r\\n\\n\\ndollar to a strange beggar, but would not lose an hour’s rest by the\\r\\n\\n\\nbedside of a sick friend,” said plain-spoken Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, there’s somebody that will do both,” said Mr. Alexander, jerking\\r\\n\\n\\nhis thumb over his shoulder in the direction of Dick. “He sat up with\\r\\n\\n\\nold Jerry Brown, who had the smallpox. I wonder if you would have liked\\r\\n\\n\\nhim so well, Anna, if he had taken it; as he might have done; and lost\\r\\n\\n\\nhis hair and eyebrows and been otherwise badly marked?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes I would, Alick! But, thank goodness, Dick, darling, you didn’t get\\r\\n\\n\\nit, and you are not marked; but just as good-looking as ever,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, defiantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, come, this is pretty quarrelling among cousins on Christmas\\r\\n\\n\\nmorning, too! Put a stop to it,” said Mrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe young people laughed and obeyed. They were only “sparring.” And they\\r\\n\\n\\nall sat down to the breakfast table in high, good humor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd little Drusilla went back to her mother, as happy as it was possible\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a child to be. And her happiness was all associated with the idea of\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander, that splendid being who had been the central object of\\r\\n\\n\\nall her wonder, curiosity and admiration, long before she had set eyes\\r\\n\\n\\non him. She had never dreamed of such bliss as she now enjoyed, and all\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough him!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUp to this time her little life had been dreary enough, more dreary than\\r\\n\\n\\neven she knew since she had known nothing better with which to compare\\r\\n\\n\\nit. Her very earliest recollections were of her father’s sick room, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhis long and painful illness; and then came his death, and her mother’s\\r\\n\\n\\nsorrow and their poverty; and finally, this situation in the family of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Chief Justice, where the child had been led to believe that her\\r\\n\\n\\npresence could be only tolerated for the sake of her mother’s valuable\\r\\n\\n\\nservices, and upon condition of herself being kept out of the sight and\\r\\n\\n\\nhearing of the family.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAll these were very miserable and gloomy antecedents; but now they had\\r\\n\\n\\npassed away like the shadows of the night; for now came this bright,\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung Mr. Alexander, to bring daylight and sunshine into her infant\\r\\n\\n\\nlife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis kindness to the pale orphan did not cease with Christmas Day. So\\r\\n\\n\\nlong as the Christmas and New-Year’s holidays lasted, Mr. Alick insisted\\r\\n\\n\\non little Drusilla sharing all the young people’s amusements; because,\\r\\n\\n\\nin point of fact, it greatly enhanced his enjoyment to have her with\\r\\n\\n\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the holidays were over, General Lyon took his grand-daughter back\\r\\n\\n\\nto school; Mr. Alexander returned to college; and the house was emptied\\r\\n\\n\\nof its visitors.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn taking leave of his pet, Mr. Alick had said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, Drusilla, when I am gone you must be my mother’s little girl,\\r\\n\\n\\ndo you hear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, how I wish I might! Oh, how I _do_ wish I might!” said the child,\\r\\n\\n\\nweeping and clinging to her friend.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mother, when I am gone, you’ll be good to the poor little thing, if\\r\\n\\n\\nonly for my sake, won’t you?” he inquired, as a feeling of real pity\\r\\n\\n\\nmoved his heart.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed I will, Alick,” earnestly replied the old lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you will not let old Bishop Sterling keep her mewed up in that\\r\\n\\n\\nhorrid room all the time?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not if I can prevent it, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith this promise Mr. Alick departed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd little Drusilla clung to the old lady’s skirts, and wept as if her\\r\\n\\n\\nheart would break.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor her the day had departed with the sun that had made its light, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe darkness of the night had come again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYou may depend upon it that the old lady sincerely sympathized with the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild who wept for _her_ son’s departure, and so she petted little\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, and took her out that day, when she went in the carriage to\\r\\n\\n\\npurchase some articles that were needed in the housekeeping.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER VI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                          THE NEXT FEW YEARS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n          When she commenced to love she could not say,\\r\\n\\n\\n          Ere she began to tire of childish play.—WORDSWORTH.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe little girl grew to be a great favorite with the old lady; first,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her beloved and only son’s sake.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor Alick was so fond of the child,” she said; though why she called\\r\\n\\n\\nthe gay and prosperous young collegian “poor,” only aged mothers can\\r\\n\\n\\ntell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfterwards she loved the little one for its own sake.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The child is such a quiet little creature,” she said, “and so\\r\\n\\n\\nintelligent and obliging.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla had the freedom of the house. When her tasks were over\\r\\n\\n\\nin the housekeeper’s room she might wander where she would, and was\\r\\n\\n\\ntolerated like a pet kitten.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe would creep into the old lady’s sitting-room, and nestle down at her\\r\\n\\n\\nfeet, ready to hold a skein of silk for her to wind; to pick up her\\r\\n\\n\\nscissors when she should drop them; to ring the bell for a servant, or\\r\\n\\n\\nto do anything else that her little hands and willing mind could\\r\\n\\n\\naccomplish.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so it came to pass that she became useful and even necessary to her\\r\\n\\n\\nbenefactress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have no idea how many steps about my room the little creature saves\\r\\n\\n\\nme,” said Mrs. Lyon to the child’s mother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very glad to hear it, madam; it is her duty to make herself\\r\\n\\n\\nuseful,” replied the housekeeper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And then she is so much company.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope she knows her place, madam, and is not pert.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She is a little dear, and I would not be without her for anything; so\\r\\n\\n\\ndon’t be troubled.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I trust in you, madam, to send her away whenever she becomes annoying\\r\\n\\n\\nto you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Quite right; when she becomes annoying I shall do so,” laughed the old\\r\\n\\n\\nlady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhenever Mrs. Lyon got letters from Mr. Alexander she read them to\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle Drusilla; and in no one could she have found a more attentive,\\r\\n\\n\\nintelligent and sympathizing listener. In almost every letter the young\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman wrote:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Give my love to my little pet, and kiss her for me,” or words to that\\r\\n\\n\\neffect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhenever Mrs. Lyon wrote to Mr. Alexander she would smilingly ask the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild what message she had to send; and little Drusilla would answer:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please say I sent him a love and a kiss; and I ask our Father to bless\\r\\n\\n\\nhim whenever I say my prayers.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the message would be faithfully transmitted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSometimes when Mrs. Lyon chanced to be out of her room the little girl\\r\\n\\n\\nwould creep to the door of Judge Lyon’s study, and peep shyly in.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd whether the old lady happened to be there or not the old gentleman\\r\\n\\n\\nwould call the child in, and pat her head, and talk to her, and feel in\\r\\n\\n\\nall his pockets for stray pennies to give her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla had but one use for pennies—“to drop in the purse” that\\r\\n\\n\\nwas carried around on Sundays in the Sunday school.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sterling, seeing how really welcome her child was, “in hall and\\r\\n\\n\\nbower,” no longer tried to keep her confined to the housekeeper’s room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo the winter passed away, and the spring opened.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEarly in the season the family, with their whole establishment of\\r\\n\\n\\nservants, migrated to Crowood, the fine old country-seat of the chief\\r\\n\\n\\njustice, situated in the dense forest-land of the valley. Of course Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling and her child went along with them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAmong woods, fields, and streams, birds, shrubs and flowers, little\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla seemed in her native element, and with her fellow-creatures.\\r\\n\\n\\nHer enjoyment of nature was intense and her delight unbounded. Her joy\\r\\n\\n\\noverflowed and communicated itself to every one in the family. Even the\\r\\n\\n\\nold justice said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The child makes me long to have my grandchildren about my knees; for,\\r\\n\\n\\nafter all, this little one isn’t ours.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, if she isn’t she’s a pet of poor Alick’s, and that makes _me_\\r\\n\\n\\nthink a deal of her,” answered Mrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old lady was a great flora-culturist, and had one of the most\\r\\n\\n\\nbeautiful flower-gardens in the country. It was her pleasure to tend it\\r\\n\\n\\nherself; and she passed much of her time in dibbling and digging,\\r\\n\\n\\nweeding and watering, planting and transplanting her favorite specimens.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd on these occasions the child was always at her heels, with little\\r\\n\\n\\nspade, rake, hoe, watering-pot, or guano basket; and she soon learned to\\r\\n\\n\\nknow the name, and watch the growth of every variety of flower as well\\r\\n\\n\\nand as carefully as her benefactress could.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon was also a poultry fancier, and had some of the finest broods\\r\\n\\n\\nin the neighborhood. Moreover, she chose to look after her hen-roosts\\r\\n\\n\\nand nests in person.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd whenever she visited her poultry yard for this purpose little\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla would walk behind her with a basket, which she would carry full\\r\\n\\n\\nof corn for the chickens, and bring back full of fresh eggs for\\r\\n\\n\\nbreakfast. And the child knew the relative merits of bantam, dominicho,\\r\\n\\n\\nduck-legged, or Spanish broods, as well as their mistress. Shanghais and\\r\\n\\n\\nCochin Chinas were unheard of in that day.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Mrs. Lyon’s pride of prides was her drove of cows—unexcelled and\\r\\n\\n\\neven unapproached in all the country around. And to these especially,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old lady often gave her personal attention.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd whenever she walked down to the cow-pen in the afternoon\\r\\n\\n\\nmilking-time, to see for herself that her cows were in a good condition,\\r\\n\\n\\nand that her milk-maids did their duty faithfully, little Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nwalked behind her, with a little basket in her hand full of small, sweet\\r\\n\\n\\napples to treat the pets. And with her own little hand she would hold a\\r\\n\\n\\nsmall apple up to the great mouth of some prize cow, and laugh to see\\r\\n\\n\\nthe long red tongue thrust out and folded around the morsel to be\\r\\n\\n\\ncrunched up by the teeth. And the child knew the name and pedigree of\\r\\n\\n\\nevery prodigious prize cow there, and could tell the distinctive points\\r\\n\\n\\nof the Durham, Alderney, Ayrshire, or other breeds.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn a word she became the old lady’s “shadow,” and she learned all the\\r\\n\\n\\nold lady could teach her without giving her teacher the least trouble,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut on the contrary a great deal of assistance. She gained much\\r\\n\\n\\npractical knowledge, if but little book learning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStrangers who saw them together invariably took the little girl to be\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old lady’s grand-daughter; and Mrs. Lyon was always rather pleased\\r\\n\\n\\nby the mistake.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd little Drusilla was “as happy as the day was long.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo passed the spring and half the summer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut in the middle of July the chief justice and his wife went to the\\r\\n\\n\\nmountains, to old Lyon Hall, on a visit to the general and his daughter,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere they expected to be joined by Mr. Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla wept over the departure of her friends; but when they\\r\\n\\n\\nwere gone she occupied herself with the commissions Mrs. Lyon had left\\r\\n\\n\\nto her—left with the purpose of interesting and amusing the lonely child\\r\\n\\n\\nduring her own absence. These were to weed the flower beds, feed the\\r\\n\\n\\nchickens, and take small sweet apples to the favorite cows at the\\r\\n\\n\\nafternoon milking-time.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAll these pleasant tasks did the little girl gladly and faithfully\\r\\n\\n\\nperform.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNevertheless the days seemed long, now that her dear old friends were\\r\\n\\n\\ngone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut days and weeks, however tedious, pass away in time.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt the end of six weeks, on the first of September, the chief justice\\r\\n\\n\\nand his wife come back to Crowood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon could not enough praise the fidelity of her little handmaiden.\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was not a weed to be found in all the flower beds; the chickens\\r\\n\\n\\nwere fat, and the cows in a good condition (though this last item was of\\r\\n\\n\\ncourse due more to the fine grazing than to the little treats of sweet\\r\\n\\n\\napples tendered to them by the little Drusilla.)\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old lady and the child became better friends than ever. Mrs. Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nhad a great deal to tell about Mr. Alexander, and little Drusilla was\\r\\n\\n\\nnever tired of listening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so three more pleasant months were passed at Crowood, and then the\\r\\n\\n\\nfamily went back to the city. They were comfortably settled in their\\r\\n\\n\\ntown house by the first of December.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon went out in the carriage to shop, and took Drusilla, and\\r\\n\\n\\npurchased for her pretty, bright colored merino dresses, suitable for\\r\\n\\n\\nchildhood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nChristmas came, and brought General Lyon, Miss Anna and Mr. Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\non their annual visit. And Mr. Richard Hammond came, an uninvited but\\r\\n\\n\\nnot an unwelcome guest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla was now always with Mrs. Lyon. The housekeeper had\\r\\n\\n\\nfairly given the child up to the old lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Mr. Alexander, who, on this occasion was the first of the Christmas\\r\\n\\n\\nparty to arrive, found Drusilla in the drawing-room, neatly dressed in a\\r\\n\\n\\ncrimson merino frock, with a ruffled white apron, and with her pretty\\r\\n\\n\\nhair curled and tied back with crimson ribbons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter affectionately greeting his mother and father, he turned to the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why—is this? No, it isn’t. Yes, it is actually my little Drusilla. Why,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat a bright little bird you have grown, to be sure!” he exclaimed,\\r\\n\\n\\nsnatching her up in his arms and kissing her boisterously, as she clung\\r\\n\\n\\naround his neck, smiling in delight, and timidly hiding her face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I will say, mother, she does you credit. You have quite\\r\\n\\n\\ntransfigured her. What have you been doing to her to improve her so\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Giving her a little more sunshine, that is all, Alick,” smiled the old\\r\\n\\n\\nlady, greatly pleased because the son of her old age was so.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I declare I never saw such a change in any creature. I left her a year\\r\\n\\n\\nago, a dingy little chimney swallow. I come back, and find her a\\r\\n\\n\\nbrilliant oriole. Indeed, I didn’t know her at first, and I shouldn’t\\r\\n\\n\\nhave known her at all, but for her eyes and forehead; _they_ will never\\r\\n\\n\\nchange. I say, father, by the way, talking of her forehead, look at it.\\r\\n\\n\\nIf there be any truth in phrenology _she_ must have intellect.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think it requires an appeal to phrenology to prove that the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild has rare intelligence,” said the chief justice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Intellect is a snare as well as beauty; goodness is the quality most to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe desired,” remarked Mrs. Lyon, gravely. Then, speaking to the child,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe added:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now run away into the garden and play for half an hour or so. This\\r\\n\\n\\nclear, frosty air outside is good for little girls.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander put his pet down, and then the little creature ran out of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I must beg you both, my husband and son, not to say such things as you\\r\\n\\n\\nhave been saying in the child’s presence again. I have too real a regard\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her to wish to have her spoiled.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right, mother; I wouldn’t do anything to spoil her for the world,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Mr. Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the chief justice also acquiesced, for the old lady was\\r\\n\\n\\nqueen-regnant in her own family kingdom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAn hour later General Lyon and Miss Anna arrived. And at night Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nRichard made his appearance. And with the coming of Dick the holidays\\r\\n\\n\\nreally commenced.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Christmas morning a great many presents were interchanged. And while\\r\\n\\n\\nrich jewelry, furs, shawls, dresses, laces, slippers, caps, gowns and\\r\\n\\n\\ngloves were given and received, little Drusilla ran from one group to\\r\\n\\n\\nanother, deeply interested and sincerely sympathizing in the pleasure\\r\\n\\n\\nand satisfaction of her friends.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have not forgotten you this time, little one; see here, what a lot of\\r\\n\\n\\npretty stories to read these long winter evenings,” said Mr. Alick,\\r\\n\\n\\nunwrapping a parcel from which he took a large volume of “Fairy Tales,”\\r\\n\\n\\nprofusely illustrated with splendidly colored engravings.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat child’s heart does not dote on Fairy Tales and on colored pictures?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla’s eyes fairly leaped with joy, and she caught the young\\r\\n\\n\\nman’s hand and kissed it eagerly, and pressed it to her heart, and put\\r\\n\\n\\nit on her head. Apparently she could not do enough to express how much\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was obliged to him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, nonsense; I’m not the Emperor of Morocco or Khan of Tartary, to be\\r\\n\\n\\nworshipped after that fashion,” laughed the young man, “and my knuckles\\r\\n\\n\\nmust be knobby sort of kissing. Up here, crimson lips, and kiss me on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe mouth, if nothing but kissing will relieve your mind. Come, Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna won’t be jealous, not now, at least, though I don’t know what she\\r\\n\\n\\nmight be if you were seventeen instead of seven.” And he took her up in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis arms, and kissed her very fondly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now see here,” he said, as he put her down again, “here is\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething else I have got for you—a pretty little _papier mâché_ writing\\r\\n\\n\\ndesk, furnished completely. See, here is an inkstand and a sand box,\\r\\n\\n\\nhere are pens of several sizes, and pencils of all qualities, and here\\r\\n\\n\\nare envelopes and note-paper of every color and shade. Now I know you\\r\\n\\n\\ncan write a little, as well as read a great deal. So, when I go away\\r\\n\\n\\nagain, I want you, instead of sending me messages, to write me nice\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle notes, and give them to my mother, and she will put them inside\\r\\n\\n\\nof hers, and send them to me. Do you hear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said the child, gravely, as the tears stole down her cheeks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, then, what are you crying for?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because you are so good to me, and—and you are going away again, and I\\r\\n\\n\\nshall not see you for—for—for a year,” sobbed the little Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Whe-ew! here’s borrowing trouble! Why, I shall not go for six weeks\\r\\n\\n\\nyet, and who knows but the world may come to an end before that time,\\r\\n\\n\\nand we may all go to Heaven together? Come, stop crying. What! you\\r\\n\\n\\ncan’t? Hey day! Do you love me as much as all that comes to?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” sobbed the child.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, if you do love me, mind what I say, and stop crying. It\\r\\n\\n\\nblubbers your face all up, and makes you ugly, and I couldn’t possibly\\r\\n\\n\\nlove an ugly little girl.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla wiped her eyes by rubbing her fists into them, and then, little\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman-like, turned her head aside, and stole a furtive glance at the\\r\\n\\n\\nmirror opposite, to see if she had made herself as ugly as Mr. Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, and finding that she _had_, she began to compose herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in a few minutes afterwards she seemed deeply interested in sorting\\r\\n\\n\\nthe contents of her writing desk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was one of the merriest Christmas seasons that the young people of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Lyon family ever passed. The weather was very fine. Everybody was in\\r\\n\\n\\ngood health and high spirits. Amusements were many and various. And\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere-ever the young party went they took little Drusilla with them. She\\r\\n\\n\\nwas the family pet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBright seasons must terminate, as well as dark ones, and the merry\\r\\n\\n\\nChristmas holidays came to an end, and the happy Christmas party\\r\\n\\n\\nseparated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAgain little Drusilla was inconsolable, until time reconciled her to the\\r\\n\\n\\nabsence of her friend.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she obeyed his order, given half in jest and half in earnest. She\\r\\n\\n\\nwrote a little letter to him to be put in every one that his mother\\r\\n\\n\\nsent. And real love-letters they were too, though scratched in the most\\r\\n\\n\\nawkward of infantile hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I love you so; I do love you so much; I do love you more than anybody\\r\\n\\n\\nin the world; every time I say my prayers I thank Our Father for making\\r\\n\\n\\nyou, and I pray to Him to bless you and to keep you good. And I do all\\r\\n\\n\\nyou tell me to do, and it makes me feel glad. And I don’t do what you\\r\\n\\n\\ntell me not to do. And when anybody wants me to do anything well that is\\r\\n\\n\\nhard, they speak your name and then it seems easy for me. I let mother\\r\\n\\n\\ncut off all my long curls and did not cry, for she said that my hair\\r\\n\\n\\nwould grow out so much nicer by the time you come back. But oh, how long\\r\\n\\n\\nit will be before you come back. But I won’t cry after you, for you say\\r\\n\\n\\nit makes me ugly and you couldn’t love an ugly little girl. Mother says\\r\\n\\n\\nI must not wish to be pretty; but oh, I do, because you like pretty\\r\\n\\n\\npeople. But if I am good you will always like me, won’t you? Is there\\r\\n\\n\\nany little girl at college that you like as well as me? You’ve got the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle dog, I know. You took him with you. To think you could take the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle dog and couldn’t take me. It does seem hard, because I love you,\\r\\n\\n\\noh so much more than the little dog could. I’m not jealous of the poor\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle dog; don’t think that, only it seems so hard, when I love you so\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSuch was the sort of ardent nonsense the little child wrote to her big\\r\\n\\n\\nhero; but after all, it was no worse nonsense than many of her grown-up\\r\\n\\n\\nsisters write to the heroes of _their_ imaginations.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Mrs. Lyon never looked into little Drusilla’s scrawls—or, if she\\r\\n\\n\\ndid, she never took the trouble to decipher them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alick would smile over them; because they pleased him. He liked to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe loved. The preference of any dumb brute was pleasing to him; how much\\r\\n\\n\\nmore so then the worship—for it was little less—of this fervent,\\r\\n\\n\\nearnest, enthusiastic little girl?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How devoted to me the little quiz is, to be sure. Christopher Columbus!\\r\\n\\n\\nif this sort of thing should grow with her growth and strengthen with\\r\\n\\n\\nher strength, what will become of me? Bosh! by the time she is seventeen\\r\\n\\n\\nor eighteen some young prig of a parson will cut me out and there an\\r\\n\\n\\nend.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Mr. Alick laughed at the conceit, and thought of the black-eyed girl\\r\\n\\n\\nhe had danced with at the last party.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut for all that he could not do without the child’s love or the child’s\\r\\n\\n\\nletters; and he cherished both.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis first year of Drusilla’s life with the Lyon family was a sample of\\r\\n\\n\\nseveral that followed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEvery Spring the family went to Crowood, taking the housekeeper and her\\r\\n\\n\\nchild and all the servants with them; and Drusilla renewed her\\r\\n\\n\\nacquaintance with woods and fields and streams; and increased her\\r\\n\\n\\nknowledge of plants, poultry, cows, and animate and inanimate nature\\r\\n\\n\\ngenerally, from personal observation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEvery midsummer she was left princess regent of the poultry yard, etc.,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile her benefactors went to visit their relatives in Old Lyon Hall in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe mountains.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEvery autumn the family returned to Richmond to spend the winter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd every Christmas came the grand family re-union, in which, to the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild’s worshipping eyes, Mr. Alexander was the central figure. This\\r\\n\\n\\nChristmas gathering became to her the crowning glory of the year, for\\r\\n\\n\\nthen she saw him. He became thus associated with all that was best and\\r\\n\\n\\nbrightest in her life. He brought her the books and pictures for which\\r\\n\\n\\nalready her intellect and imagination had begun to hunger. He always\\r\\n\\n\\nexamined into the progress of her education; though that was scarcely\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessary, for the constantly improving style of her letters to him\\r\\n\\n\\nrevealed her steady advance. I believe that with her bright\\r\\n\\n\\nintelligence, she would have studied well from the pure love of\\r\\n\\n\\nknowledge, even if Mr. Alexander had never patronized her; but now all\\r\\n\\n\\ncooler motives were lost in the ardent desire to please her friend. And\\r\\n\\n\\nindeed she did please him; he was proud of her, vain of her, not as if\\r\\n\\n\\nhe had been her father, but as if he had been her creator. He seemed to\\r\\n\\n\\nthink, as she grew in beauty and bright intelligence, that he had made\\r\\n\\n\\nher what she was. To his apprehension, he was the sun and she the\\r\\n\\n\\nsun-flower, ever turning towards him for light and life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEvery one, who is not blindly selfish, likes to patronize where to do so\\r\\n\\n\\ncosts little or nothing. Mr. Alexander’s patronage of this child amused\\r\\n\\n\\nand interested him; cost him nothing; but won for him a vast return of\\r\\n\\n\\nlove and gratitude.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER VII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                        THE GIRL’S FIRST GRIEF.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n             One hurried kiss, one last, one long embrace,\\r\\n\\n\\n             One yearning look upon her tearful face,\\r\\n\\n\\n             And he was gone—C. H. W. ESLING.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt ten years of age little Drusilla met her first great grief; and very\\r\\n\\n\\nheavy it was, for it nearly crushed out her life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander being twenty-two years of age, and having completed his\\r\\n\\n\\ncollege course, graduated with some honors, and returned home to spend a\\r\\n\\n\\nweek or two of the beautiful spring weather with his parents previous to\\r\\n\\n\\nstarting on his travels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe family had not yet left the town house in Richmond, where General\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon and Miss Anna, now a blooming young lady of sixteen, came to visit\\r\\n\\n\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDuring this visit it was arranged that Mr. Alexander should travel for\\r\\n\\n\\ntwo years and then return and marry Miss Anna, and that the young couple\\r\\n\\n\\nshould take up their permanent abode at Old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut in all the interest and excitement of arranging his own and his\\r\\n\\n\\npromised bride’s affairs, Alexander did not neglect Drusilla. He had\\r\\n\\n\\ncome into a little property of his own, left him by a bachelor brother\\r\\n\\n\\nof his mother; and so before he went away he said to the old lady:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mother, little Drusilla is going on eleven years old and ought to be\\r\\n\\n\\nsent to school. And I wish you, if you please, to look out a good one\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her, the best that can be found, and send her. I wish you to do this\\r\\n\\n\\nfor me at my expense. My money is in the City Bank, and I will leave you\\r\\n\\n\\na number of blank checks, to fill up as you may require them. Will you\\r\\n\\n\\nattend to this for me, mother?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon hesitated and pondered, and then answered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick. I can’t refuse you anything on the eve of a voyage. And I\\r\\n\\n\\ndon’t see any harm in this—a good common school education——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, mother, not that only; but the best—the very best—that can be got\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her. See what a bright, intelligent, industrious little creature she\\r\\n\\n\\nis,” hastily interrupted Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What! do you mean that she shall learn languages and music, and——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n—“Everything that a young lady is taught, mother. Everything that Anna\\r\\n\\n\\nknows. Why not? Think how small the cost, after all, to me; how great\\r\\n\\n\\nthe good to her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is true, Alick. You are really a very noble-minded young man. I\\r\\n\\n\\nmust say it, if you are my son.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bosh, mother, begging your pardon, I’m nothing of the sort. But I like\\r\\n\\n\\nto do a good thing now and then.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And this will be a good thing for her. It will enable her to get her\\r\\n\\n\\nliving as a governess.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not a bit of it, mother; Heaven forbid that my child should ever become\\r\\n\\n\\na governess, to be teased by stupid children and snubbed by insolent\\r\\n\\n\\nmammas.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I am afraid you and Anna will have to adopt her,” said the old\\r\\n\\n\\nlady drily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And what’s to hinder us? Think what a charming companion my child will\\r\\n\\n\\nbe for Anna, and how much more charming if she should be well educated.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, you talk as if you were her father.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I feel as if I was!” said the young man, as a real tenderness\\r\\n\\n\\nsoftened the expression of his face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next day Mr. Alexander left home for his distant travels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNo one took the parting hard but his mother and his “child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis father and his uncle shook hands with him heartily, wishing him a\\r\\n\\n\\ngood voyage. His mother held him to her heart and prayed and wept over\\r\\n\\n\\nhim. Miss Anna kissed him with a cordial, cousinly smack, and told him\\r\\n\\n\\nnot to forget her in foreign parts.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut when he lifted Drusilla up, as he had been accustomed to do, and\\r\\n\\n\\nkissed her on the mouth once, twice, thrice, and said feelingly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I cannot do this when I come back again, my child!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe clung to his bosom and gasped, but could make no reply, she was so\\r\\n\\n\\nsuffocated with grief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe set her down very gently and went away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe general and the judge looked for the morning papers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Anna sat down to cut the leaves of a new novel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut old Miss Lyon took the hand of the pale, tearless, motionless child,\\r\\n\\n\\nand led her away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla, sensitive, impressible and inexperienced, dropped under\\r\\n\\n\\nthe heavy blow that had fallen on her with all the force of a first\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat sorrow. She fell ill, nearly unto death, moaning, in her\\r\\n\\n\\nsemi-delirium, snatches of her grief:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, don’t go! don’t go! Two years—two long, long years! Oh! so far\\r\\n\\n\\naway! His man could go with him, and not I—not I who will die about it!\\r\\n\\n\\nOh, come back! come back, or I will die—indeed I will die!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon soothed this distress as well as she was able, and when, after\\r\\n\\n\\nweeks of illness, the little girl grew better, the old lady told her of\\r\\n\\n\\nall Mr. Alexander’s plans for her welfare—that he had decided she must\\r\\n\\n\\nbe sent to school and educated like a young lady; that afterwards she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas to be taken to live as a companion to Miss Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla listened very humbly and gratefully to this communication; but\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch as she loved knowledge, and anxious as she was to acquire it, she\\r\\n\\n\\nfelt too bereaved and sorrowful to take delight in that or in anything\\r\\n\\n\\nelse, as yet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs soon as the child recovered her health, she was fitted out and put to\\r\\n\\n\\none of the best boarding schools in the city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer mother made no objection, only mumbled to herself this piece of\\r\\n\\n\\nphilosophy:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If we don’t know much of the future, of this we may be certain—when we\\r\\n\\n\\nexpect anything to turn out _this_ way, it will be sure to turn out\\r\\n\\n\\n_that_. I thought the child was going to be a nuisance and a bore, and\\r\\n\\n\\nbehold! she is a treasure and a pet! And so it is with everything!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd meanwhile, with one great bond of sympathy between them, the old\\r\\n\\n\\nlady and the little girl grew faster friends than ever.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut her devotion to Alexander—it grew with her growth and strengthened\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her strength. It was her one faith, hope, love—her inspiration, her\\r\\n\\n\\nreligion, her soul; it was a part of herself—no, her _very_ self—this\\r\\n\\n\\nall-absorbing, all-concentrating, all-devoting love to him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis bosom was her home, though he might never let her into it; what the\\r\\n\\n\\nnest is to the bird his bosom was to her—the bourne of all her thoughts,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe safe and happy resting-place of her heart, though as yet she was an\\r\\n\\n\\nexile from it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe sphere of study was around her; it did not govern her, but served\\r\\n\\n\\nher, for all that she could get from it was drawn in to help the one\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat moving power of her being. She loved learning so much for his\\r\\n\\n\\nsake, that she did not know whether she loved it for its own. Her\\r\\n\\n\\nexpanding intellect seemed only her enlarging love. Her advancement in\\r\\n\\n\\nknowledge seemed only to be progress towards him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe seemed to herself to belong to him—to have been made _for_ him, made\\r\\n\\n\\n_of_ him, almost _by_ him. She was as the rib taken from her Adam’s\\r\\n\\n\\nside, conscious of her dislocation, and longing to be put back again,\\r\\n\\n\\nand made one with the life of her life. If Alexander had died at this\\r\\n\\n\\ntime, I think that Drusilla would have ceased to live.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOne other such case as hers I have seen in common life, and that must be\\r\\n\\n\\nnameless, and one I have met in history, the love of the child-queen,\\r\\n\\n\\nIsabella, for her grown-up consort, Richard II. And that there are many\\r\\n\\n\\nother instances of such devotion, I have no doubt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla remained at the “Irving Institute” for nearly three years. With\\r\\n\\n\\nher love of knowledge and desire for improvement, her quick perception\\r\\n\\n\\nand retentive memory, her progress in education was both easy and rapid.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs yet she had not seen enough of the world to know herself by\\r\\n\\n\\ncomparison with others, so there were some things in her school life\\r\\n\\n\\nthat gently moved her wonder; first, in the study hours, to see that the\\r\\n\\n\\npursuits which were pastime and delight to her, were labor and vexation\\r\\n\\n\\nto most of her classmates; and second, at the school parties, to which\\r\\n\\n\\nthe younger brothers of the pupils were invited, to see girls of her own\\r\\n\\n\\nage actually engaged in flirtations with boys who were no older than\\r\\n\\n\\nthemselves, and who seemed to her, to be children.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith the great religion, idolatry—call the passion what you will—that\\r\\n\\n\\ninspired her soul, she could not understand such silliness in her\\r\\n\\n\\ncompanions, and therefore, pretty and intelligent as she was, her\\r\\n\\n\\nreserve made her somewhat unpopular.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe wrote to Mr. Alexander every week, because he had requested her to\\r\\n\\n\\ndo so and she had promised, and also because writing to him was the\\r\\n\\n\\ngreatest pleasure she had in this world except receiving his letters.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe wrote to him regularly every week, as I said; and about once in two\\r\\n\\n\\nmonths, on an average, she got a letter from him; but she could not\\r\\n\\n\\ncomplain for his mother got one no oftener, and both made excuses for\\r\\n\\n\\nhim; he had “so much to engage his attention,” they said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length, when he had been gone more than two years, the letters\\r\\n\\n\\nceased, or seemed to cease, altogether. Several months passed, and\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing was heard of Mr. Alexander. His father opined that he had passed\\r\\n\\n\\nover into Africa, where post-offices were few, and mails doubtful, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhoped that he would soon return into a more civilized section of the\\r\\n\\n\\nworld, from which he would write to his relations.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Mrs. Lyon grieved and complained. She was sure that he had been\\r\\n\\n\\nkilled by the Arabs of the Desert, or sold into slavery by the Algerine\\r\\n\\n\\npirates.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla pined in silence, or if she opened her mouth to speak upon the\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject, it was to try to encourage her old friend, and herself also.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe told Mrs. Lyon that Bedouin outrages and Barbary piracies were\\r\\n\\n\\nhorrors belonging to the past. She showed her the modern map of Africa,\\r\\n\\n\\nand pointed out how few and far apart were the points from which letters\\r\\n\\n\\ncould be sent home, and she sought to demonstrate that the absence of\\r\\n\\n\\npost-offices and mail routes was the all-sufficient cause of the silence\\r\\n\\n\\nof the traveller in Africa. Thus she succeeded in cheering the old lady;\\r\\n\\n\\nand whenever Mrs. Lyon felt more discouraged than usual, she always\\r\\n\\n\\nsought Drusilla to be comforted by her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon thought as the judge thought, that Alexander being in\\r\\n\\n\\nAfrica could not write home; and he wished as the judge did, that the\\r\\n\\n\\nwanderer might soon return to Europe, civilization, and post-offices.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Anna never troubled her head about the matter. She was his promised\\r\\n\\n\\nwife, and so his mother hoped that he might write to her, if to no one\\r\\n\\n\\nelse. And Mrs. Lyon often wrote to Anna, to ask if she had heard from\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick yet. And Anna always answered—“I have not had a letter from him\\r\\n\\n\\nfor ages. _He has forgotten me._” And Anna’s “wish was father to this\\r\\n\\n\\nthought.” And furthermore, she advised her correspondent not to be\\r\\n\\n\\nuneasy. Alick, she thought, would come back safe in time, no doubt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPeople who are not anxious can be so rational!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut at length suspense was ended.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was early in December. The judge and Mrs. Lyon were in their town\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse, looking forward to the annual Christmas visit of the general and\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon, when the old lady received a letter from her son. It was\\r\\n\\n\\ndated from Paris, and contained the joyful news that he had returned\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom Africa in perfect health and spirits, and was going over to\\r\\n\\n\\nSouthampton to take the first steamer bound for New York; and that soon\\r\\n\\n\\nafter they should get his letter they might expect him in person.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon, after reading this letter to her husband, and receiving his\\r\\n\\n\\ncomment:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I told you so. I shall be glad when he is safe at home, though;”\\r\\n\\n\\nhurried off to the Irving Institute, to tell the joyful news to the only\\r\\n\\n\\none from whom she would be sure of perfect sympathy, in this her great\\r\\n\\n\\nhappiness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe sent for Drusilla into the reception parlor, and told her all the\\r\\n\\n\\nnews, and then read the letter to her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl clung to her old friend and wept with delight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This letter came by the steamer that got into New York harbor on\\r\\n\\n\\nWednesday. This is Friday, and there is another due this week! He may be\\r\\n\\n\\nin it!” said Mrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There is another due now, and he will be sure to be in it. Think,\\r\\n\\n\\nmadam, the steamer that brought this letter should have been in last\\r\\n\\n\\nSaturday. The steamer that should have followed it in order must be at\\r\\n\\n\\nher pier now. We may expect Mr. Alexander by every train,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, as soon as she had recovered her composure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is true! So we may! And, my dear child, you always say something\\r\\n\\n\\nto comfort or delight me! And you shall go home with me directly, so as\\r\\n\\n\\nto be there to welcome him when he arrives. There is nobody in the world\\r\\n\\n\\nhe will be gladder to see. And this is Friday afternoon, and of course\\r\\n\\n\\nthere are to be no lessons Saturday or Sunday, and so you can just as\\r\\n\\n\\nwell as not go home with me and stay over until Monday. I will speak to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe principal about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she rung the bell, and desired the parlor-maid who answered it to\\r\\n\\n\\ntake her respects to Mrs. Irving, and say that she should be pleased to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee her in the parlor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I told the judge to write to the general, and let him and Anna know\\r\\n\\n\\nthat Alick was expected every day, so they might hasten their coming.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut la! you know, my dear, these cross-country mails are so slow, it\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be impossible for them to receive the letter in time to get here to\\r\\n\\n\\nwelcome him on his first arrival. However, I know they will come as soon\\r\\n\\n\\nas ever they can. And I suppose we may prepare for a gay wedding soon.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd no doubt you will be one of the bridesmaids. You are quite old\\r\\n\\n\\nenough—nearly thirteen, and I like the bridesmaids to be much younger\\r\\n\\n\\nthan the brides.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so the delighted old lady twaddled on until the door opened, and\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Irving entered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Mrs. Lyon soon told her news and made her boon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the accomplished principal warmly congratulated her visitor, and\\r\\n\\n\\ngraciously granted the request.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla left the parlor to prepare for her ride, and in ten minutes\\r\\n\\n\\nreturned, ready to accompany Mrs. Lyon home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey reached the house in time for the old lady to hustle into the\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper’s room, and order sundry dishes of oysters, poultry, game,\\r\\n\\n\\npastry, cakes and jellies added to the bill of fare for supper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“For you know he may arrive by the nine o’clock train—that is the first\\r\\n\\n\\none in,” said the old lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who may arrive, Madam?” inquired the housekeeper, who had not heard one\\r\\n\\n\\nword of the good news.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My son, to be sure, you stupid woman—who else?” exclaimed Mrs. Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\ndelightedly. And then she poured forth the news of the letter she had\\r\\n\\n\\nreceived from him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh!” said Mrs. Sterling. And she turned and kissed her daughter,\\r\\n\\n\\ninquiring:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How came you out of school?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madame brought me home with her to welcome—my benefactor,” answered\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, returning her mother’s kiss.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh,” said the housekeeper a second time. “Well, I’m going to be very\\r\\n\\n\\nbusy to get up all these dishes in time for supper, so don’t interrupt\\r\\n\\n\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can I not help you?” asked Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, you would only hinder me. I have no time to direct new hands now,”\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered her mother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come with me, Drusilla, my dear, and we will go and see that his rooms\\r\\n\\n\\nare opened and aired,” said the old lady, beckoning to her favorite.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey went up stairs together, attended by Mary, the colored housemaid.\\r\\n\\n\\nThis girl herself could have done the duty well enough alone; or at most\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the instruction of either Mrs. Lyon or Drusilla; but both chose to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee to the work and make it a labor of love.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe handsome bed-chamber, with dressing-room and bath attached, was\\r\\n\\n\\nopened and aired. A fine fire of sea coal was lighted in the polished\\r\\n\\n\\nsteel grate. His rich dressing gown was taken out from the sandal-wood\\r\\n\\n\\nchest into which it had been packed with sundry other garments he had\\r\\n\\n\\nleft at home: and it was shaken well and hung over the resting chair\\r\\n\\n\\nbeside the fire. His slippers were laid upon the rug. A complete and\\r\\n\\n\\nwell-dried change of clothing was spread out upon the bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“For you see, my dear, his luggage may not be here for hours after he\\r\\n\\n\\narrives; and he will want to change his dusty travelling suit for clean\\r\\n\\n\\nclothes as soon as possible, so as to be sweet and nice and comfortable\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the evening,” said Mrs. Lyon, as she laid a couple of fresh, scented\\r\\n\\n\\npocket-handkerchiefs beside his other personal equipments.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen fine soap and fresh towels were laid upon his wash-stand. And the\\r\\n\\n\\nBohemian glass bottles on his dressing-table were filled—one with\\r\\n\\n\\nCologne water and the other with Macassar oil. Finally the wax candles\\r\\n\\n\\neach side the glass were lighted. And then, after a glance around to see\\r\\n\\n\\nthat all was right, Mrs. Lyon called Drusilla and the housemaid to come\\r\\n\\n\\nafter her, and left the apartment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe passed to her own chamber and put on her best black moire antique\\r\\n\\n\\ndress, and her finest point lace cap and collar.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then she went down into the drawing-room to wait for her son.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And after all, we have no assurance that he will come to-night. We do\\r\\n\\n\\nnot even know that the steamer is in, or if it is, that he is aboard,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsighed the aged mother impatiently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He will come to-night, Madam. In one hour he will be here. I feel sure\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he will,” said Drusilla, cheerfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                              FATAL LOVE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                           Childhood’s lip and cheek\\r\\n\\n\\n           Mantling beneath its earnest brow of thought;\\r\\n\\n\\n           And in the flute-like voice murmuring low,\\r\\n\\n\\n           Is woman’s tenderness, how soon her woe!\\r\\n\\n\\n           Her lot is on thee, silent tears to weep,\\r\\n\\n\\n           And patient smiles to wear through painful hours,\\r\\n\\n\\n           And sumless riches from affection’s deep,\\r\\n\\n\\n           To pour on broken reeds—a wasted shower!\\r\\n\\n\\n           And to raise idols and to find them clay,\\r\\n\\n\\n           And to bewail that worship—therefore pray.—HEMANS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe came, even before be was expected. By some happy chance the train was\\r\\n\\n\\nin half an hour earlier than usual.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Mrs. Lyon had gone into the “study,” to have a chat with the judge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla was alone in the drawing-room, when a cab dashed swiftly up to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe street-door, the bell rang sharply, and was answered quickly; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthere was a pleasant bustle of arrival in the hall, and Mr. Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nburst into the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe looked not fatigued or travel-stained, but flushed and excited with\\r\\n\\n\\nexercise and anticipation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith an irrepressible cry of joy, Drusilla sprung to meet him, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nsuddenly recoiled, blushed and trembled between delight, timidity and\\r\\n\\n\\nembarrassment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander caught her hand, gazed in her face, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why—Who are you? I ought to know. Your face seems familiar, and\\r\\n\\n\\nyet—DRUSILLA!” he suddenly cried, as he recognized and caught her up in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis arms, and covered her face with kisses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Welcome! Oh, welcome!—I am so glad you have come at last!—I never was\\r\\n\\n\\nso happy in my life!” she tried to say, as she dropped her head upon his\\r\\n\\n\\nshoulder and wept with delight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And my child is the first one to welcome me!” said Alexander, sitting\\r\\n\\n\\ndown on a sofa and drawing her upon his knee, where she sat, painfully\\r\\n\\n\\nembarrassed yet unwilling to move, lest she should wound his affection\\r\\n\\n\\non this, the first day of his return.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All are well?” he inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Quite well,” she answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ay, so the servant told me at the door. Where is my mother?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Just stepped from the room. I expect her back every instant.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, what a beautiful girl you are growing to be!” he said, looking\\r\\n\\n\\ndown with earnest admiration at the long, black eye-lashes that, being\\r\\n\\n\\ncast down, shaded and softened the crimson cheeks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come! look up at me; I wish to see if your eyes are changed. I never\\r\\n\\n\\ncould decide whether they were gray or hazel. Let me see!” he said,\\r\\n\\n\\nputting his hand under her chin to lift her face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked up with a quick and quickly withdrawn glance, and her cheeks\\r\\n\\n\\ndeepened in their hue. She hated to sit on his knee, where years ago she\\r\\n\\n\\nhad sat a hundred times, and she hated to hurt his feelings by leaving\\r\\n\\n\\nhim; and she doubted whether she loved him now as well as she did then,\\r\\n\\n\\nand whether her love was not turning into something very much like\\r\\n\\n\\ndistrust and dread; and she wondered why this should be so, and secretly\\r\\n\\n\\nblamed and disbelieved in herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Am I so altered by travel that you don’t like to look at me?” he asked,\\r\\n\\n\\nsmilingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh no, sir, you are not altered, except to be—improved,” she forced\\r\\n\\n\\nherself to say, with courtesy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were interrupted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She is too great a girl for that sort of thing now, Mr. Alexander, if\\r\\n\\n\\nyou please. Be so good as to put her down, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was the voice of the housekeeper that spoke, as she entered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, Mrs. Sterling,” said Alexander, laughing, and\\r\\n\\n\\nreleasing his favorite; “but it is hard to realize that my little pet is\\r\\n\\n\\ngrowing up.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She is thirteen, sir,” curtly answered the housekeeper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear me! Is she so? Why I dandled her when she was a baby! What an old\\r\\n\\n\\nman I am growing to be, to be sure!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not quite old enough to be her father, Mr. Alexander, and therefore too\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung to make a pet of her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, now, this is a pretty way to welcome me home with a rebuke the\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst thing.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very glad to see you home, sir, however; and—Here is Mrs. Lyon!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe housekeeper cut her speech short, as the old lady entered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, my son! my son!” she cried, and fell sobbing for joy in his arms.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe housekeeper withdrew, taking her daughter with her, and leaving the\\r\\n\\n\\nmother and son alone together.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nArrived in her own room, Mrs. Sterling sat her daughter down before her,\\r\\n\\n\\nand began to lecture her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla—she preached—must not allow Mr. Alexander to pet her and caress\\r\\n\\n\\nher _now_, as he had done before he went away. Drusilla was too great a\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl now, for that sort of thing. Truly, she was not a woman yet; but\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was growing into one, and so the familiarities that were quite\\r\\n\\n\\ninnocent when she was a child, would be extremely improper now that she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas almost a young woman. Such was the purport of the sermon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla trembled excessively, and wept a little over this exordium. In\\r\\n\\n\\nher heart she agreed with it, but grieved over it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was just such a lecture as any prudent mother might have given her\\r\\n\\n\\ngrowing daughter under the circumstances. But Drusilla, while\\r\\n\\n\\nacquiescing in its propriety, was shocked by its plainness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTheir interview was interrupted by the voice of Mrs. Lyon, who came\\r\\n\\n\\nherself in search of her favorite.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where are you, Drusilla, my dear? Come and thank your benefactor for\\r\\n\\n\\nall that he has done for you, and show him how much you have profited by\\r\\n\\n\\nhis kindness,” said the old lady, as she came in.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBlushing and embarrassed, the girl followed the lady to the\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander had changed his travelling suit for an evening dress, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwas sitting talking to Judge Lyon about the voyage home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, at a sign from Mrs. Lyon, seated herself near the talkers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I want you to see how much your protegée has improved, Alick,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick’s mother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I _have_ seen, Madam,” answered Alexander with a smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“After supper I want her to sing and play for you. She has a wonderful\\r\\n\\n\\nproficiency in music,” said Mrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall be glad to have a specimen of her skill, mother,” said the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung man, turning to his father, and taking up the thread of the broken\\r\\n\\n\\nconversation, in order to relieve Drusilla, who was embarrassed by all\\r\\n\\n\\nthis notice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat between her own half-consciousness and her mother’s severe lecture,\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla was perplexed and distressed. The great pleasure she had\\r\\n\\n\\nanticipated from the arrival of Alexander was mixed with strange pain—a\\r\\n\\n\\npain not the less poignant because she could not understand it. To\\r\\n\\n\\nbecome the cold and formal stranger to him that her mother wished her to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe, seemed impossible; while to continue the familiar child-pet that she\\r\\n\\n\\nhad hitherto been to him was not to be thought of. If he had only been\\r\\n\\n\\nher brother, so that she might have had a right to his caresses, how\\r\\n\\n\\nhappy she could have been, she dared to think.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut as it was, she could scarcely venture to glance at him, because each\\r\\n\\n\\nglance thrilled her soul with such strange, wild emotion, half delight,\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf dread. Ah, friends, she was a child of the sun, fervent, earnest,\\r\\n\\n\\ndevoted in all her ardent soul. She was already, all unknown to herself,\\r\\n\\n\\ndeeply and passionately attached to Alexander Lyon. The budding love of\\r\\n\\n\\nyears had this evening burst into full bloom. And yet it was even more\\r\\n\\n\\nreligion than love, and more worship than passion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSupper was announced and every one arose.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, Drusilla, you are the only young lady present,” said Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\ntaking her hand to lead her in to supper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe felt that small hand flutter and throb within his own like the heart\\r\\n\\n\\nof a captured bird. He turned suddenly and looked at her. Her eyes were\\r\\n\\n\\ncast down, and her cheeks were crimson. He gazed on her for a moment in\\r\\n\\n\\ngrave silence, and then slightly frowning, led her on into the dining\\r\\n\\n\\nroom, and placed her in a chair at the table. He paid her all due\\r\\n\\n\\nattention at the supper, but with a certain reserve that he had never\\r\\n\\n\\nused with her before.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe evening meal was, notwithstanding this, a very happy one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe judge chatted gaily with his restored son, encouraging him to talk\\r\\n\\n\\nof his wanderings in the old world.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old lady listened with pleased attention, and only once in a while\\r\\n\\n\\nbroke her silence to ask whether he had been presented to all the queens\\r\\n\\n\\nin Europe, and which was the most beautiful woman among them, or some\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch question as that.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer son answered that he saw no woman in Europe prettier than some he\\r\\n\\n\\nfound at home; and he glanced at Drusilla with a smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl beaming in the light of his countenance, and drinking in the\\r\\n\\n\\nmusic of his voice was intensely happy and—vaguely wretched.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen supper was over they went back into the drawing-room, and Mrs. Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nmade Drusilla sit down to the pianoforte and play and sing for\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders at the proposition, but politely acquiesced\\r\\n\\n\\nand prepared to be bored. Alexander was a connoisseur in music, and he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad heard the very best singers of the day. Consequently he had little\\r\\n\\n\\npatience with the crude efforts of young misses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe, Drusilla, began with a very simple song—chosen in compliment to the\\r\\n\\n\\nnewly-arrived son:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n    “Home again! home again! from a foreign shore,\\r\\n\\n\\n    And oh, it fills my soul with joy to meet my friends once more.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt first her voice trembled slightly; but the tremor only added to its\\r\\n\\n\\npathos; and as she went on it gained strength and volume. She sang with\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch feeling and expression. And Alexander was surprised, and pleased\\r\\n\\n\\nand profoundly affected.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My child, you sing well; I tell you so, who have heard the best singers\\r\\n\\n\\nin the world. Your voice has reached the depths of my heart, Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nand awakened it to a deeper consciousness of its joy in home-coming,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nwhispered as she finished her song.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe bowed her head, partly in meek acknowledgment of this praise, and\\r\\n\\n\\npartly to conceal the blush that overspread her cheeks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, that little song is very pretty and very appropriate, but it is\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing to what she can do. Sing Casta Diva, my dear,” said Mrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla raised an imploring glance to the old lady’s face, but met with\\r\\n\\n\\nno reprieve there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, my dear! the Casta Diva!” she repeated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith a deprecating look at Alexander the girl took down another volume\\r\\n\\n\\nof music, and turned to the selections from Norma. The piece chosen by\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon was a great trial to any immature and half-cultivated voice\\r\\n\\n\\nlike Drusilla’s, however excellent the quality of that voice might\\r\\n\\n\\nnaturally be; and Drusilla knew this, and thence her imploring and\\r\\n\\n\\ndeprecating glances.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are too exacting, mother. She cannot sing that; I do not think any\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman under thirty years old could, unless she had had a very remarkable\\r\\n\\n\\nand precocious experience,” said Alexander, laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ay, you say that because you know nothing of the intuitions of genius.\\r\\n\\n\\nYou must hear your protégée sing, and you will understand better,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThus urged on, Drusilla began to sing. Her voice arose tremulously, as\\r\\n\\n\\nat first, like a young bird fluttering out of its nest, but then it\\r\\n\\n\\nsoared and swelled, gaining power and volume, until it filled all the\\r\\n\\n\\nair with the music of that wild, impassioned, agonized, terrible\\r\\n\\n\\ninvocation and appeal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCertainly Drusilla had never known remorse, anguish or despair, yet all\\r\\n\\n\\nthese wailed forth in her soul-thrilling tones.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe ceased, and dropped her head, exhausted, on her book.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander made no comment, but took her hand and led her from the\\r\\n\\n\\ninstrument, and then went and resolutely shut it down.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There! what do you think of that?” demanded the old lady, triumphantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will tell you some other time,” said Alexander, and he took and\\r\\n\\n\\nlighted a bedroom candle, and put it into Drusilla’s hand, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good night! go to bed, my child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla took the light and turned to the old lady, and held up her face\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a kiss.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Mrs. Lyon stooped and touched her lips, saying, with a smile:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I suppose I may kiss you _now_.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander held the door open until the girl had passed out, and then he\\r\\n\\n\\nshut it after her and returned to his seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do you know, Alick, why I said to Drusilla just now, ‘I suppose I may\\r\\n\\n\\nkiss you _now_?’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, mother.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I’ll tell you. You remember how you kissed her when you went\\r\\n\\n\\naway?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Alick! your departure nearly killed your poor little pet. If you\\r\\n\\n\\nhad been her own father, she could not have grieved after you more than\\r\\n\\n\\nshe did. She had a low fever, and after she got well she would not let\\r\\n\\n\\nany one kiss her. She said that you had kissed her last, and that no one\\r\\n\\n\\nelse should touch her lips until you should return and kiss her again.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Did she now, really,” exclaimed Alexander, with emotion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She did indeed, and she kept her word.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander reflected a moment, and then spoke:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mother!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tell her teachers that I do not wish and will not permit, Drusilla to\\r\\n\\n\\nlearn opera music or love songs. Let her confine herself to sacred music\\r\\n\\n\\nonly.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But Alick, my son, how absurd! I am particular enough, the dear knows,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut I don’t see any harm in good opera music. All young ladies learn it,\\r\\n\\n\\nand you desired that she should learn all that young ladies do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I was hasty; and now I say that she must give up opera music and such\\r\\n\\n\\nlike. Let her learn and practice sacred music to her heart’s content and\\r\\n\\n\\nher soul’s salvation. Let music be the means, not of drawing her\\r\\n\\n\\naffections down to earthly follies, but of fixing them more steadfastly\\r\\n\\n\\nupon heavenly things.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick, you do astonish me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I astonish myself, sometimes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Pray have you got religion, as the phrase goes?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; I wish to the Lord I had. But I want her to have it. Mother!” he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, with sudden energy, going towards the old lady, “you don’t know\\r\\n\\n\\n_how_ I love that child; you can’t feel how I love her—how near and dear\\r\\n\\n\\nshe seems to me—how near and dear she has always seemed since I first\\r\\n\\n\\nlooked into her soft, sweet, patient eyes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I believe you love her as much as if you were her father.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Her father! well, I suppose my affection for her has something paternal\\r\\n\\n\\nin it, but fathers seldom love their daughters as I love her. Instance:\\r\\n\\n\\nFathers are willing to give their daughters away in marriage, but I am\\r\\n\\n\\nvery sure that I would rather see Drusilla dead than married.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old lady stared at the young man, utterly unable to comprehend him.\\r\\n\\n\\nHe continued:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mother, I tremble for that child. I trembled when I heard her sing that\\r\\n\\n\\nCasta Diva as I never heard a good or happy woman sing it. There could\\r\\n\\n\\nnot have been _memory_—there must have been _prophecy_ in those wild,\\r\\n\\n\\ndespairing wails.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There was intuition, and nothing more. But you have been to Germany,\\r\\n\\n\\nand I suppose you have grown mystical,” said Mrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“By which you mean mad. Very likely. Perhaps my previsions are\\r\\n\\n\\nillusions: but mother, I nevertheless must _insist_ that Drusilla shall\\r\\n\\n\\ndrop opera and take up church music. Let her teachers know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Certainly, Alick. And now light my candle and wake up your father; it\\r\\n\\n\\nis bed time.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander lighted and handed the wax taper to his mother, and then\\r\\n\\n\\ngently roused his father, who had been comfortably napping in his easy\\r\\n\\n\\nchair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the trio separated and went to rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER IX.\\r\\n\\n\\n                             BRIDAL FAVORS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n               Love was to her impassioned soul,\\r\\n\\n\\n               Not as to others, a mere part\\r\\n\\n\\n               Of her existence, but the whole,—\\r\\n\\n\\n               The very life-breath of her heart.—MOORE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n             The world was not for her, nor the world’s art\\r\\n\\n\\n             For one as passionate as Sappho’s heart.\\r\\n\\n\\n             Love was born with her, in her, so intense,\\r\\n\\n\\n             It was her very spirit, not a sense.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Saturday morning Alexander walked out to renew his acquaintance with\\r\\n\\n\\nhis native city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon said to her pet:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you know any very fine sacred music, my dear, I wish you would\\r\\n\\n\\nselect some pieces and practice them this forenoon, so as to be able to\\r\\n\\n\\nexecute them well this evening for Alexander.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla, glad to have her morning’s work laid out, sat down to go\\r\\n\\n\\nover portions of Handel’s Messiah.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander came home to luncheon, and in the afternoon attended his\\r\\n\\n\\nmother and Drusilla for a drive.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey dined and tea’d together, and adjourned to the drawing-room, where,\\r\\n\\n\\nat Mrs. Lyon’s command, Drusilla sat down to the piano and sang to her\\r\\n\\n\\nown accompaniment on the instrument the all glorious “Te Deum.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander was enraptured. It is scarcely too much to say that he was\\r\\n\\n\\ntransported—listening to the heavenly notes of her voice and gazing on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe inspired beauty of her face. As for her she seemed all unconscious\\r\\n\\n\\nof everything around her, as though her soul were winging its way to\\r\\n\\n\\nHeaven in those strains of divine music.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the last notes of her voice died away, there was silence in the\\r\\n\\n\\nroom for some moments. It was gently broken by Alexander murmuring in\\r\\n\\n\\nher ear:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My child, sacred music is your forte. Consecrate your glorious gift to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe worship of the Most High.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla bowed her head; and after a few moments said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“They want me to sing in the choir of St. John’s church. Would you like\\r\\n\\n\\nme to do so?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My child, that must be as you please. Would you like it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed I do not know until I hear your will,” she murmured.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I will you to sing there,” he smiled.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I am sure I shall like it,” she said. “And now shall I sing the\\r\\n\\n\\nHallelujah for you, and will you help me? There should be four voices,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You shall sing no more to-night, my bird; but come to the centre table,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere I have some gleanings of travel to show you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander’s servant had in fact just placed upon the table a large\\r\\n\\n\\nportfolio containing interesting views of natural scenery and of works\\r\\n\\n\\nof art, collected in their travels. And in examining these the remainder\\r\\n\\n\\nof the evening passed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Sunday all the family went to St. John’s church together. But as\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla was not yet a member of the choir she sat in the Lyons’ pew.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Monday morning, Mr. Alexander himself took his protegée back to her\\r\\n\\n\\nschool. He was known there as a “patron,” and his request that his young\\r\\n\\n\\nward, Miss Sterling, should confine her musical studies to the sacred\\r\\n\\n\\nbranch of the art, met with a prompt acquiescence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeaving Drusilla under the charge of her teachers, he returned to his\\r\\n\\n\\nhome to find it very dreary in the absence of his “child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A letter from your uncle, the general,” said Mrs. Lyon, as she received\\r\\n\\n\\nhim in the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He says that Anna declines to hasten her visit upon ‘any gentleman’s\\r\\n\\n\\naccount;’ and so they will not be with us before Christmas eve.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Humph!” said Mr. Alexander, seating himself with much indifference.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do not know that I can blame her. Certainly it is not _her_ place to\\r\\n\\n\\nrun after _you_, Alick, even if she _is_ your promised bride. She must\\r\\n\\n\\nstand upon her dignity, I suppose.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, well, just as she pleases; but I cannot but compare her with one\\r\\n\\n\\nwho consults her heart and not her dignity where I am concerned.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t be a coxcomb, Alick, my dear. You mean little Drusa? She’s a\\r\\n\\n\\nchild and has everything to learn yet of proper self-respect in her\\r\\n\\n\\nassociation with gentlemen. But we are not talking of her just now. I\\r\\n\\n\\nhate to send you from me, Alick; but I really do think you are bound to\\r\\n\\n\\npay Anna the respect of going to Old Lyon Hall. I would go myself, if I\\r\\n\\n\\nfelt equal to the journey, and take you as an escort; but as I am, I\\r\\n\\n\\nmust let you go alone. There is a coach leaves to-morrow at seven in the\\r\\n\\n\\nmorning. What do you think of taking a place in it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I would as lief as not.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Upon my word! If Anna is as indifferent in this matter as you are, I\\r\\n\\n\\nthink it is a pity you two were ever betrothed,” said the old lady,\\r\\n\\n\\nlooking over the tops of her spectacles.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander laughed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Our betrothal is such an old story, mother, and we are used to it.\\r\\n\\n\\nBesides it rests upon such a solid foundation—having one foot upon\\r\\n\\n\\nCrowood and the other on Old Lyon Manor—that we feel secure in it. And\\r\\n\\n\\nwherever there is security there must be indifference.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where did you learn to sneer, Alick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am not sneering. Heaven forbid. My Cousin Anna is a beautiful and\\r\\n\\n\\naccomplished young lady, for whom I have great respect and esteem. When\\r\\n\\n\\nI see her I shall press her to name an early day for the nuptials. And\\r\\n\\n\\nno doubt we shall get along as well as most people.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Humph! when _I_ was young lovers were in love. I suppose you have\\r\\n\\n\\n‘changed all that now.’ Pray, Alick, did you see any lady in Europe whom\\r\\n\\n\\nyou very much admired?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander laughed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, of course, mother! Scores and scores! But they are last summer’s\\r\\n\\n\\nleaves and blossoms, dispersed and forgotten. At least I shall bring to\\r\\n\\n\\nmy bride a heart single to her service. For if I am not madly in love\\r\\n\\n\\nwith Anna, I am not in love with any one else, unless you call my\\r\\n\\n\\nfatherly fondness for little Drusilla—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense!” shortly interrupted the old lady—“that child! Don’t be\\r\\n\\n\\nprofane, Alick. Have some reverence for innocence like hers.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander fidgetted and made no answer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I didn’t mean to scold you, dear; only I would have you respect\\r\\n\\n\\nholy childhood, and let a girl be a child as long as possible. I hope\\r\\n\\n\\nand believe that you and Anna will make a happy couple. When you see\\r\\n\\n\\nher, of course you will say everything that is kind to her from me; and\\r\\n\\n\\nbe sure you cannot say too much. You will either prevail on them to come\\r\\n\\n\\nimmediately to us, or you will stay with them until they are ready to do\\r\\n\\n\\nso,” said Mrs. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander agreed to everything she proposed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then their interview was interrupted by the entrance of some\\r\\n\\n\\nvisitors.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next morning Alexander went up the country to old Lyon Hall, where\\r\\n\\n\\nhe used his powers of persuasion to such good purpose as to prevail on\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Anna, and of course on her grandfather, to return with him\\r\\n\\n\\nimmediately to Richmond.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If he will not go back with us, we must go with him, I suppose,\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandpa. It would be a pity to deprive Aunt Lyon of her son’s society by\\r\\n\\n\\nkeeping him here, so soon after his arrival from foreign parts,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Anna, expressing a sentiment with which the old gentleman sincerely\\r\\n\\n\\nsympathized.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo the whole party reached the city by the following Saturday.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Christmas holidays were spent as merrily as ever before. Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nwas brought from school to join in the festivities of the season, and\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was loaded with presents and caresses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Richard Hammond also came, and was quite as much up to every species\\r\\n\\n\\nof fun and frolic as ever he had been in his earlier boyhood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was very much with Anna, but neither her lover nor her relations\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed to take any exception to his attendance. She was so nearly\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried now that there could be no danger of his supplanting her\\r\\n\\n\\nbetrothed, and besides, he was her near cousin, poor fellow, they\\r\\n\\n\\nargued, and so Mr. Dick was allowed to dance attendance upon Miss Anna,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile Mr. Alexander amused and interested himself in his “child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe wedding of the affianced pair was fixed to take place early in the\\r\\n\\n\\nnew year, at Old Lyon Hall, whither the whole of both families would\\r\\n\\n\\nmeet to do honor to the nuptials.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anna, you have not invited me to the wedding,” said Dick one day, as\\r\\n\\n\\nthey stood together in the recess of the bay window.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I invite you now, Dick! Come and be Alick’s best man.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’d see him drowned first, dash him! I’d sooner be his headsman!” said\\r\\n\\n\\nthe young man, grinding his teeth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then why do you wish to come to his wedding?” asked Anna, elevating her\\r\\n\\n\\neyebrows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Did I say I ‘wished’ it? Don’t jump to conclusions, Anna. I don’t wish\\r\\n\\n\\nit. I merely reminded you that I was not invited. You remember the fairy\\r\\n\\n\\nthat was not invited to the princess’s christening? She came all the\\r\\n\\n\\nsame, but her christening gift proved no blessing. I shall go to your\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding, Anna, but the wedding present that I shall lay upon your table\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be no peace-offering,” he whispered between his white lips.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe turned pale, and then red, and then she laughed to conceal her\\r\\n\\n\\nagitation, as she answered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t be melo-dramatic, whatever you are. None but stage-struck\\r\\n\\n\\napprentices ever are so. All that sort of thing is obsolete. If a young\\r\\n\\n\\nman is crossed in love, he had better marry for money. Alick and I must\\r\\n\\n\\nmarry and settle like other sensible people. He will devote himself to\\r\\n\\n\\nimproving the race of oxen and the growth of corn, and amuse his leisure\\r\\n\\n\\nwith politics; I shall draw prizes for poultry, butter, and perhaps\\r\\n\\n\\nflowers. Life is prose, not poetry, Dick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Look at that child. _She_ does not think as you do,” said Richard,\\r\\n\\n\\nbitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna raised her eyes and saw, at the opposite end of the room, in a\\r\\n\\n\\nrecess filled with row above row of blooming flowers, this group:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander was reclining in an easy chair, holding in his right hand a\\r\\n\\n\\nsmall volume, from which he was reading in a subdued voice, and\\r\\n\\n\\nencircling with his left arm the shoulders of his “child,” who was\\r\\n\\n\\nsitting on a low seat beside him. His eyes were on his book, but hers\\r\\n\\n\\nwere on him. Forgetting her timidity, forgetting herself, her inspired\\r\\n\\n\\nface was raised to his, with glowing crimson lips apart, and slender\\r\\n\\n\\nblack eyebrows arched, and large, starry eyes fixed on him, as she\\r\\n\\n\\nlistened breathlessly to his words. He finished a sentence, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nturned to speak to her. And instantly her eyes fell, and her color rose\\r\\n\\n\\neven to her brows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I see; if she were a little older, or I a little more in love, I\\r\\n\\n\\nshould be jealous,” thought Anna within herself. But she said nothing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt the end of Christmas holidays Drusilla was sent back to school.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, under the charge of old Mrs. Lyon, did a vast deal of shopping in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe city, besides sending to New York for articles that could not be\\r\\n\\n\\nprocured in Richmond.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen all this was done, she returned with her grandfather to Old Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nHall, where they were soon to be joined by the judge and Mrs. Lyon, and\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander, for the wedding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe day after the general and his grand-daughter left, Mrs. Lyon said to\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick, Anna wishes little Drusilla to be her sixth bridesmaid.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I object to that. The girl is too young to have marrying and giving in\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage running in her head.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense, Alick, you can’t keep this affair out; of course she knows\\r\\n\\n\\nyou and Anna are about to be married.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Of course she does, for she has heard nothing else talked of for a\\r\\n\\n\\nmonth past,” said Alexander, in a tone of vexation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then let her be Anna’s sixth bridesmaid.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, mother, if you please. It would take her from her studies.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, Alexander, you forget. She must be at the wedding any way, for it\\r\\n\\n\\nwould never do to slight the child by omitting to take her to it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do not see that. Let her know that it is by _my_ will that she is to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe left at school, and she will easily submit to the disappointment.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, Alick, I think that would be cruel.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I know it to be necessary for her own sake, mother.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next morning the father, mother and son, attended by their men and\\r\\n\\n\\nmaid servants, set out in their travelling carriage for Old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTravelling by easy stages, and stopping at all the most comfortable inns\\r\\n\\n\\non the road, to eat or sleep, they at length arrived safely on the\\r\\n\\n\\nevening of the third day at the old mansion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe house was full of company, and all alight from attic to basement. So\\r\\n\\n\\nmany young friends of the bride were staying with her for the wedding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOur city party was very cordially received. Anna herself took the old\\r\\n\\n\\nlady to her room, and waited on her in person. But—\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where is Drusilla?” was one of the first questions she asked of\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“At school. Where is Dick?” he answered and retorted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“At his office in the city, I suppose. But—Drusilla! why is she not\\r\\n\\n\\nhere?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I would not let her come. But—Dick! why is _he_ not here?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I would not let him come. And—Drusilla was to have been my bridesmaid!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And—Dick was to have been my groomsman!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd here the young cousins looked in each other’s faces and laughed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a merry party that gathered in the drawing-room that evening.\\r\\n\\n\\nYoung ladies and gentlemen were grouped in small circles around various\\r\\n\\n\\ntables, engaged in diverting parlor games of one sort or another.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe general and the old lady were playing chess together.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe chief justice, only, complaining of cold and fatigue, excused\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself from joining in any game, though he declined to go to bed, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsat in the most comfortable arm-chair in the warmest corner of the\\r\\n\\n\\nfire-place, sipping hot punch from a glass on a stand at his elbow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen his moderate glass was empty he spread his white handkerchief over\\r\\n\\n\\nhis face, and lay back in his chair and dozed, undisturbed by all the\\r\\n\\n\\nmusical chatter and silvery laughter around him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt ten o’clock there was a tray of refreshments brought in, and handed\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst to the old lady, who was served by the general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNext the tray was handed to the judge. The servant who carried it stood\\r\\n\\n\\nin silence for a moment, and then said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir, his honor is asleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon immediately turned and playfully whisked the handkerchief from\\r\\n\\n\\nher husband’s head and asked him what he meant by being so rude as to\\r\\n\\n\\nfall asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was no response by word or motion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe bent forward and looked in his face, and then screamed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer scream brought all the company in alarm around her. Her hand was on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old man’s pulse, and her face was pale and wild with fright.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon gently replaced her in her seat, and went back to the\\r\\n\\n\\njudge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in one moment more it was ascertained beyond a doubt that Chief\\r\\n\\n\\nJustice Lyon was dead.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYou may imagine what a terrible shock this sudden death gave. How the\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding-party broke up in confusion and dispersed in sadness; how the\\r\\n\\n\\nunavailing skill of the family physician was called in, to do no more\\r\\n\\n\\nthan pronounce upon the cause of death—apoplexy; how the funeral was\\r\\n\\n\\nsolemnized in his own old ancestral halls; and how his body was laid at\\r\\n\\n\\nlast in the family vault at old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, who had not been permitted to attend the wedding, had been\\r\\n\\n\\nsent for to come to the funeral. She came, sorrowing bitterly over the\\r\\n\\n\\nsudden death of one who had been the kindest old friend to her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe did not go back again to school. Mrs. Lyon, overwhelmed by the loss\\r\\n\\n\\nof the life-partner with whom she had lived so long, needed constant and\\r\\n\\n\\naffectionate attention, and entreated that her favorite should be left\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUnder the circumstances of her bereavement Alexander could refuse his\\r\\n\\n\\nmother nothing. So Drusilla remained in attendance upon her\\r\\n\\n\\nbenefactress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe widow, exhausted by grief and unable to travel, staid with the\\r\\n\\n\\ngeneral and his grand-daughter all the winter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, engaged in setting his late father’s family affairs in order,\\r\\n\\n\\npreparatory to administering on his estate, went backwards and forwards\\r\\n\\n\\nbetween Richmond and Old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLate in the following spring Mrs. Lyon went to Crowood, taking Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe first few days at the old country-seat, where she had passed so many\\r\\n\\n\\ntranquil, happy seasons with her lost husband, renewed all her grief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Drusilla, guided by a happy instinct, drew her out among her\\r\\n\\n\\nflowers, and fowls, and cows and other pets and hobbies.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMost fortunately, I say, all these had been grossly neglected during her\\r\\n\\n\\nabsence, as though under the circumstances of her bereavement, her\\r\\n\\n\\nannual visit was not expected. And the old lady, the mourning widow,\\r\\n\\n\\nseeing the condition of her favorites, ceased to weep like Niobe, and\\r\\n\\n\\nbegan to scold like Xantippe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd of course she got better directly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt took her and her handmaid Drusilla, assisted by a staff of men and\\r\\n\\n\\nmaids, the whole summer to bring flowers, poultry and cows up to the old\\r\\n\\n\\nlady’s standard of perfection. And by the time this was done her health\\r\\n\\n\\nand cheerfulness returned.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was nothing, now that the chief justice was off the bench forever,\\r\\n\\n\\nto call her to the city. So she determined to make Crowood her permanent\\r\\n\\n\\nresidence. With this view she wrote to the housekeeper, who had remained\\r\\n\\n\\nin charge of the city house, to pack up her personal effects and forward\\r\\n\\n\\nthem to Crowood, and then to come down herself, as the house was to be\\r\\n\\n\\nput into the hands of architects, decorators, and upholsterers, to be\\r\\n\\n\\nthoroughly renovated for the use of the young pair, whose wedding-day\\r\\n\\n\\nwas again fixed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Lyon was the more urgent for her housekeeper to hasten to Crowood,\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause there was a contagious fever of a very malignant type raging in\\r\\n\\n\\nRichmond.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn answer to her letters, Mrs. Sterling sent down, by a wagon express,\\r\\n\\n\\nabout seventy trunks, boxes and bundles, and within a week followed\\r\\n\\n\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very glad you have arrived, Sterling. I had not an easy hour while\\r\\n\\n\\nyou remained in the city, exposed to that terrible fever. And Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nwould have been as anxious as I was if she had known the danger; but I\\r\\n\\n\\nkept it concealed from her. It was of no use to trouble the child,” Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon said, in welcoming her housekeeper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the poor old lady of Crowood congratulated herself before the danger\\r\\n\\n\\nwas over.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nApparently, Mrs. Sterling had brought down the seeds of fever in her\\r\\n\\n\\nsystem, for the day after her arrival she was taken with a shivering\\r\\n\\n\\nfit, followed by a glow of heat, head-ache, nausea and prostration, and\\r\\n\\n\\nin twenty-four hours she was in a raging fever and delirium.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old lady was not a coward; she was a conscientious Christian. Now\\r\\n\\n\\nthat the fever had come, she faced it. She sent for the country doctor,\\r\\n\\n\\nand instead of trusting the sick woman to the care of servants, she,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith Drusilla’s assistance, nursed the patient in person. This course of\\r\\n\\n\\nconduct was more magnanimous than prudent.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sterling, “tough as a pine knot, and with no more nerves than it,”\\r\\n\\n\\nas the country doctor said, survived the fever and got up, though with a\\r\\n\\n\\nbroken constitution, for all those whom that dreadful pestilence spared\\r\\n\\n\\nto life it ruined in health.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Mrs. Lyon contracted the disease, and it made but short work with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe feeble old lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the beginning of her illness her son was summoned in haste from\\r\\n\\n\\nRichmond; but though he used his utmost speed in hurrying to her\\r\\n\\n\\nbedside, he only arrived in time to hear her last wishes and receive her\\r\\n\\n\\ndying blessing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You must not grieve after me, Alick, my dear. Think what a long and\\r\\n\\n\\nhappy life I have had up to this time. But think, now that your father\\r\\n\\n\\nis gone, how lonely I must be. I want to be with him, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThese were almost her last words. She fell into stupor and revived only\\r\\n\\n\\nonce more, long enough to lay her hand on her son’s head and bless him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBy her expressed wish her body was carried to Old Lyon Hall, and placed\\r\\n\\n\\nin the vault beside that of her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the wedding was put off for another year.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There is a fatality in it. We shall never be united, or if we should be\\r\\n\\n\\nthe union will bring nothing but woe,” said Anna to her grandfather.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wait until it is put off a third time, my dear, before you make such a\\r\\n\\n\\nfatal prediction,” answered the general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter the burial, Mr. Lyon went down to Crowood, where his presence was\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessary to the settlement of some local business.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere more melancholy news met him. Mrs. Sterling, whose brain had been\\r\\n\\n\\nseriously affected by the fever, was now certainly losing her reason,\\r\\n\\n\\nand Drusilla was almost broken-hearted between the death of her dear\\r\\n\\n\\nfriend and the infirmity of her dear mother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt is said that madness often reverses the whole moral character. Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling who, in her proper senses, had been one of the most active,\\r\\n\\n\\nenergetic and domineering of women, was now one of the meekest,\\r\\n\\n\\ngentlest, and most harmless of lunatics. Her illusions were all\\r\\n\\n\\ninnocent, and some of them amusing. Sometimes she fancied herself the\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress of Crowood. At other times she imagined that Alexander and\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla were married, and making a visit to her there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer pleasing illusions did not prevent her from performing all her\\r\\n\\n\\nhousehold duties, only she discharged them in the capacity of mistress,\\r\\n\\n\\nnot manager.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon consulted the country doctor, who told him that in Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling’s case there was a gradual softening of the brain that must\\r\\n\\n\\nprove fatal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA part of Alexander’s business at Crowood was to take Drusilla back to\\r\\n\\n\\nschool. But it was now certain that she must not be separated from her\\r\\n\\n\\nmother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor Drusilla’s sake, he wished that Mrs. Sterling might have the best\\r\\n\\n\\nmedical advice. So he decided to take her to Richmond, to be examined by\\r\\n\\n\\nthe faculty there. But as she persisted in imagining herself mistress of\\r\\n\\n\\nCrowood, instead of the hired housekeeper of the master, to be directed\\r\\n\\n\\nby his will, she refused to leave the place.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen Alexander, taking advantage of the hallucination in regard to the\\r\\n\\n\\nsupposed marriage of Drusilla and himself, let a day or two pass, to\\r\\n\\n\\nenable her to forget the first proposal, and then invited her to pay\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself and her daughter a visit at their new house in the city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis the harmless lunatic readily consented to do. And she immediately\\r\\n\\n\\nbegan to prepare for the journey with a regularity and dispatch not to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe excelled by the sanest mind. It was evident that her mental infirmity\\r\\n\\n\\ndid not incapacitate her for the functions of her office.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey went to Richmond and took up their abode in the town house, that\\r\\n\\n\\nhad been thoroughly renovated and refurnished in honor of that expected\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage which had never yet come off.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sterling was delighted with all she saw, and complimented her\\r\\n\\n\\nimagined son-in-law on his taste and liberality, and congratulated her\\r\\n\\n\\ndaughter on her excellent husband and comfortable home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPoor Drusilla could only throw an appealing glance at the master, which\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed to pray forgiveness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Alexander laughed and pressed her hand, as he whispered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Never mind, my dear! Perhaps her imaginings are not _all_ lunacy. They\\r\\n\\n\\nmay be _second-sight_. Who knows?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe spoke half in jest and half in earnest, and drew her to his bosom,\\r\\n\\n\\nand held her there for a moment. But when he felt the wild beating of\\r\\n\\n\\nher heart against his own, and when he saw the deadly paleness of her\\r\\n\\n\\ncheek as it rested against his breast, he suddenly released her, half\\r\\n\\n\\nrepenting his act.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sterling seemed to think such billing and cooing very foolish,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough quite natural, between bride and bridegroom, for as she looked at\\r\\n\\n\\nthem she murmured:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, poor souls, they think it is always going to be just so. La! look\\r\\n\\n\\nat any middle-aged married couple you know, and see the difference.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile Mr. Lyon, holding his “child’s” hand, stooped and whispered to\\r\\n\\n\\nher.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, my little darling, I hope I have not hurt your feelings, have\\r\\n\\n\\nI?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe shook her head and tried to speak, but only gasped instead, and hid\\r\\n\\n\\nher face in her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are growing out of all this now, I know. Almost a young woman, you\\r\\n\\n\\nare, turned fourteen, but it is hard to think you so; you seem still to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe my own precious child,” he whispered gently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStill she did not answer, but wept softly behind her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusa, my daughter, you are not displeased with me, are you? I would no\\r\\n\\n\\nmore willingly displease you than I would the highest lady in the land,”\\r\\n\\n\\nhe continued.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, no, no! You could not do so. Don’t mind me. I do not know why I\\r\\n\\n\\nweep. I don’t indeed. I am a fool, I think.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That’s certain,” said Mrs. Sterling, dryly, “and so is he. Young people\\r\\n\\n\\nare apt to be fools in their honeymoon, but time cures them.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was a very dry method in the madness of Mrs. Sterling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe housekeeper took possession of her old rooms, but as they too had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen re-papered, painted and furnished, she scarcely recognized them\\r\\n\\n\\nagain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla had the little chamber that had been given her by Mrs. Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\nand was now renovated, as a spare room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander had his own superb suit of apartments.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon called in the best medical science and skill to the aid of Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling. But the unanimous opinion of the faculty endorsed that of the\\r\\n\\n\\ncountry doctor, and there was little hope of the patient’s recovery.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the month of December opened, Mr. Lyon wrote to his uncle and to\\r\\n\\n\\nhis betrothed, inviting them to come as usual, and spend the Christmas\\r\\n\\n\\nholidays at his house in Richmond, and reminding them that the meeting\\r\\n\\n\\nwould be one of a quiet family party, excluding all other visitors, and\\r\\n\\n\\nabstaining from all gayety, in respect to the memory of the departed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna wrote back on behalf of her grandfather and herself, saying that\\r\\n\\n\\nshe could not make a visit to a house where there was no lady to receive\\r\\n\\n\\nher, and she begged that Alexander would come for once and pass his\\r\\n\\n\\nChristmas at Old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOf course Mr. Lyon could do nothing but accept this invitation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he dutifully went to pass the season with his promised bride.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd these were the most dismal Christmas holidays he had ever known. He\\r\\n\\n\\nmissed his genial father, his loving mother, and yes, it must be\\r\\n\\n\\nconfessed, he missed his “child,” and he could not help contrasting the\\r\\n\\n\\nwarm devotion of his little “daughter” with the cool indifference of his\\r\\n\\n\\npromised wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis visit to Old Lyon Hall came to a sudden end. He received a letter\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom one of the servants of the city house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sterling had died suddenly, if he pleased, and what was to be done\\r\\n\\n\\nwith Miss Drusilla?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon showed that letter to Anna, made his excuses to the general,\\r\\n\\n\\nand set off at once for Richmond.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER X.\\r\\n\\n\\n                      WHAT WAS DONE WITH DRUSILLA.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n          Master, go on, and I will follow thee\\r\\n\\n\\n          To the last gasp with truth and loyalty—SHAKSPEARE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander arrived at his town house early in the afternoon. He was met\\r\\n\\n\\nby his confidential servant, Dorset, an old man who had been in the\\r\\n\\n\\nservice of the family for nearly thirty years.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, Dorset, so the poor woman is gone?” sighed the young gentleman,\\r\\n\\n\\nas he entered the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir; and not too soon, with reverence be it spoken. She had grown\\r\\n\\n\\nvery foolish and helpless within the last few days. She died without\\r\\n\\n\\nillness or suffering, sir. She went to bed as usual one night and was\\r\\n\\n\\nfound dead next morning. Miss Drusilla, sleeping by her side, heard no\\r\\n\\n\\nsound and felt no movement, and knew nothing of what had occurred until\\r\\n\\n\\nshe arose for the day.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How shocking! The second sudden death in the family within twelve\\r\\n\\n\\nmonths. And the third in all. Where is the poor girl?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Miss Drusilla? She has not left the corpse, sir, since the death. She\\r\\n\\n\\nis watching by it now.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is very wrong. It should not have been permitted.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear sir, who was to hinder her? There is no one, or I should say,\\r\\n\\n\\nthere _was_ no one in authority here to prevent her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is very true. But go now and tell the poor child that I am here,\\r\\n\\n\\nwaiting to see her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will you go to your room first, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, I came up by the boat and made my toilet just before landing. I\\r\\n\\n\\nwill wait here for Drusilla.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDorset went away with the message.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in about ten minutes, Drusilla, pale, drooping and woe-worn, entered\\r\\n\\n\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander arose and took her in his arms and silently folded her to his\\r\\n\\n\\nbosom. And she bowed her head upon his shoulder and wept softly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My poor child! My poor, dear child, you don’t know how sorry I am for\\r\\n\\n\\nyou,” said Alexander, tenderly caressing her, and repeating the same\\r\\n\\n\\nwords over and over again, until at length through her sobs and tears\\r\\n\\n\\nshe answered them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes I do; oh, yes indeed I do know how good you are and how much you\\r\\n\\n\\npity us both—poor mother, dying as she did, and—me too.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear Drusilla, you shall never want a friend while I live, or a home\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile I have one,” he murmured, smoothing her disordered hair with his\\r\\n\\n\\nhand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know that too. It is not that. I am not afraid. But oh! if I had not\\r\\n\\n\\nslept that night, perhaps she would not have died,” cried the girl,\\r\\n\\n\\nbreaking into fresh and passionate sobs and tears.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, my dearest, you talk wildly,” he said, trying to soothe her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, no, no, I know what I am saying. If I had only sat up and\\r\\n\\n\\nwatched her that night, I might have seen the change and saved her\\r\\n\\n\\nlife.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, Drusilla, I learn that your poor mother was in her usual health of\\r\\n\\n\\nbody when she went to bed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir, so she was; else I certainly would have sat up with her.\\r\\n\\n\\nOh, I wish I had! I wish I had! I would give my life now to have done\\r\\n\\n\\nit. Oh, my poor mother! my poor dear mother. I slept on by your side and\\r\\n\\n\\nlet you die—die alone, without help, without even a word of love. Oh, my\\r\\n\\n\\nmother!” cried the girl, utterly losing her self-command, and weeping\\r\\n\\n\\nand sobbing and raving as if her heart would break or her brain madden.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander let the wild gust of sorrow spend its strength, and then he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, if you had been sitting by your mother’s bed, gazing on her\\r\\n\\n\\nsleeping face, you would never have suspected that she was dying and\\r\\n\\n\\nnever known the moment of her death. My child, she had a fatal malady of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe brain that was certain to end just as it did. She passed away\\r\\n\\n\\npeacefully in her sleep. Hers was an easy death. Drusilla, do not add\\r\\n\\n\\ncauseless regrets to natural grief with these _ifs_. Nearly all persons\\r\\n\\n\\ndo so, however. I never knew any one to die whose mourning friends did\\r\\n\\n\\nnot add irrational remorse to rational sorrow by the means of these\\r\\n\\n\\n_ifs_. _If_ we had done this; _if_ we had not done that; _if_ such a\\r\\n\\n\\ndoctor had been called, or such a remedy administered. These\\r\\n\\n\\nretrospective _ifs_ are illusions. Do not let them deceive you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThese words he spoke, while with a gentle mesmeric touch he smoothed her\\r\\n\\n\\nhair and her brow, and held her head close to his bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe had neither the power nor the will to leave her resting-place; but\\r\\n\\n\\nher wild weeping softened into low sobs, that became fewer and farther\\r\\n\\n\\nbetween, until at last they ceased entirely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander looked down and saw that she was fast asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLike a baby she had cried herself to sleep on his sheltering bosom. She\\r\\n\\n\\nwas no longer pale; her long-curved eye-lashes, gemmed with tears, lay\\r\\n\\n\\non her flushed cheeks, and her slightly crimson lips showed the little\\r\\n\\n\\npearly teeth within; her dark brown disordered hair fell around a\\r\\n\\n\\nforehead and down a neck as white as ivory.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEven in that solemn hour, Alexander, looking down upon her, loved her\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her wondrous beauty, seen in its new phase of sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut he had grace to know that such feelings were sacrilege against this\\r\\n\\n\\npure maiden and sacred orphan; and so he gently arose and crossed the\\r\\n\\n\\nroom to a large sofa and laid her on it. And then he touched the bell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDorset answered it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Send one of the women servants here,” said Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe man bowed and went away, and was succeeded by a fat, motherly,\\r\\n\\n\\nmiddle-aged person who answered to the name of Molly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander silently pointed to the form on the sofa.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! Lors-a-messy! poor gall! So she’s gone to sleep at last. Well, sir,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat will be the first sleep she’s had since Sunday night, and this is\\r\\n\\n\\nWednesday. Night and day has she watched by the corpse and nobody to\\r\\n\\n\\nhinder her,” said the fat woman, holding her sides and panting, as she\\r\\n\\n\\ngazed on the sleeping orphan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_You_ should have hindered her,” said Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Me! Lors-a-messy! I couldn’t ha’ done it except by main force, which I\\r\\n\\n\\nhad no right to use.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well; let that pass. What I wish to know now is, whether she can be\\r\\n\\n\\nundressed and put to bed comfortably without being waked up.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lors-a-messy, yes, sir! When they’s been watching and weeping three\\r\\n\\n\\ndays and nights and then draps down and falls asleep, they might’s well\\r\\n\\n\\nbe in a trance, far’s waking up goes. Bless you, sir, you could hardly\\r\\n\\n\\nwake her up if you was to fire off a pistol over her head.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’m glad to hear you say so, but I have no wish to try the experiment.\\r\\n\\n\\nI will carry her up stairs myself. Do you go before and open the doors,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Alexander, tenderly raising the sleeping girl in his arms and\\r\\n\\n\\ncarrying her, preceded by Molly, up two flights of stairs, to Drusilla’s\\r\\n\\n\\nown little room. Here he laid her on the bed, and leaving her to the\\r\\n\\n\\ncare of the woman, retired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe went to the dinner that had been hastily prepared for him. And when\\r\\n\\n\\nhe had got through with it he went into the late justice’s study and\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled up Dorset to a consultation about the funeral.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn answer to his master’s question, Dorset said that the late\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper was laid out in her own room; that orders had already been\\r\\n\\n\\ngiven for a plain, respectable funeral, which was fixed for the next\\r\\n\\n\\nday. And Dorset hoped that Mr. Lyon approved of what he had done.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. You have saved me so much trouble, that I almost think my\\r\\n\\n\\npresence here might have been dispensed with,” said Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir, I only wrote to you to ask what should be done with\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Drusilla, seeing that this would no longer be a proper home for\\r\\n\\n\\nher,” said the old man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“True; I must think about that after the funeral. Of course she can’t\\r\\n\\n\\nleave the house while her mother’s corpse remains in it,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, musingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he mused so long that he forgot the presence of Dorset, until he\\r\\n\\n\\nhappened to look up and see the old man still standing respectfully\\r\\n\\n\\nwaiting orders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh!—you may go now,” he then said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the old servant bowed and retired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next day at noon the funeral took place. The clergyman’s widow was\\r\\n\\n\\ncarried to her grave in the cemetery attached to the church to which she\\r\\n\\n\\nbelonged.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, the sole mourner, rode in a coach with Alexander. Her head,\\r\\n\\n\\nheavy with sorrow, rested on his shoulder, and his arm encircled her\\r\\n\\n\\nwaist. She never thought whether this was right or wrong. She was borne\\r\\n\\n\\ndown with grief, and she leaned upon him who was her only earthly\\r\\n\\n\\nsupport and comfort.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe had never even thought of putting herself into “decent mourning” for\\r\\n\\n\\nher lost mother. She was still wearing black for old Mrs. Lyon, and so\\r\\n\\n\\nshe really needed no new outfit, except the black crape bonnet and heavy\\r\\n\\n\\ncrape veil; and these the forethought of the women servants had provided\\r\\n\\n\\nher with.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander sustained his “child” through all the last trying scene by the\\r\\n\\n\\nopen grave. And when it was closed he took her home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn entering the house he gave her into the charge of the motherly Molly,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith orders that she, Drusilla, should take a cup of tea, and go to her\\r\\n\\n\\nroom and lie down for the rest of the day. This was Thursday.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Friday Alexander wrote to his cousin, giving an account of the\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper’s death and burial, and saying that henceforth he intended\\r\\n\\n\\nto adopt Drusilla, and that he should take her back to school on the\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowing Monday.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCould Alexander have foreseen the bitter mortification he was destined\\r\\n\\n\\nto meet there he would as soon have plunged into a fire as entered that\\r\\n\\n\\nschool-house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, grieving incessantly, kept her room until Sunday, when she\\r\\n\\n\\ncame down to breakfast for the first time since the funeral.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander received her as if she had indeed been his daughter or his\\r\\n\\n\\nbeloved younger sister. He kissed her and placed her in her seat. In the\\r\\n\\n\\ncourse of the meal he told her that on the next day he should take her\\r\\n\\n\\nback to the Irving Institute to resume and continue her studies until\\r\\n\\n\\nshe should graduate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla tried to express her acquiescence in the plan, and her thanks\\r\\n\\n\\nfor his kindness, but her voice faltered, and her eyes filled with\\r\\n\\n\\ntears.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe looked wistfully in her face and read her thoughts, and answered\\r\\n\\n\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You weep at the idea of being sent away from——” He hesitated, and then\\r\\n\\n\\ncontinued: “from all you have left to love at a time when you want so\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch consolation. My dear child it is necessary for more reasons than\\r\\n\\n\\none. But I shall spend the winter here as usual, Drusilla, and I will go\\r\\n\\n\\nto see you at the school at least twice a week.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know that you are very good and all that you do is perfectly right. I\\r\\n\\n\\ndo not question these. But I must weep a little, and I feel you will\\r\\n\\n\\nhave patience with your child,” she murmured.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My child never tries my patience,” said Alexander, tenderly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey arose from the table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander was rather a negligent Christian, but on this day he attended\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla to church.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Monday morning he ordered the carriage, and took her to school.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen they arrived they were shown as usual into the visitors’ parlor,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere they waited while the parlor-maid took Mr. Lyon’s card up to the\\r\\n\\n\\nprincipal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA longer interval than usual on such occasions passed before the door\\r\\n\\n\\nswung open, and the stately Mrs. Irving entered. She bowed to Mr. Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\nand started slightly on seeing Drusilla, and betrayed as much surprise\\r\\n\\n\\nand annoyance as it was possible for so cultivated and self-possessed a\\r\\n\\n\\nlady to exhibit. She sat down, however, and waited for her visitor to\\r\\n\\n\\nopen his business.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have brought your pupil back to you, Madam,” said Mr. Lyon, bowing\\r\\n\\n\\nand waving his hand towards Drusilla, who immediately arose and curtsied\\r\\n\\n\\nto her former schoolmistress, and then resumed her seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said the lady, very coldly, “I regret to say that it is not\\r\\n\\n\\nconvenient for us to receive Miss Sterling.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander looked surprised, not so much at the words as at the coldness\\r\\n\\n\\nwith which they were uttered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am sorry to hear you say so, Madam. Your house is full then, I\\r\\n\\n\\npresume.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe lady hesitated for a moment, and then seeing that Mr. Lyon was\\r\\n\\n\\nlooking at her and waiting for an answer, she said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, it is not full.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander was more surprised than ever.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, Madam, may I ask why—but I beg your pardon; you have certainly\\r\\n\\n\\nthe right under any circumstances to decline a pupil. I would be glad to\\r\\n\\n\\nknow, however, whether Miss Sterling’s tuition fees were in arrears at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe time she was temporarily withdrawn, or if they are so now?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, sir; Mrs. Lyon settled the account.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then why—Again I beg pardon; I have no right, perhaps, to ask your\\r\\n\\n\\nreason for declining to receive my ward. But I will venture to say that\\r\\n\\n\\nif there was any misunderstanding as to the cause of her withdrawal\\r\\n\\n\\ntwelve months ago, I am happy to assure you that it was from no\\r\\n\\n\\ndissatisfaction with the school or its teachers, or its discipline; and,\\r\\n\\n\\nin short, that no offence was meant, and I hope none was taken.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“None, I assure you sir; for we all quite understood that Miss Sterling\\r\\n\\n\\nwas taken from school to attend upon her guardian, Mrs. Lyon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander’s surprise grew into amazement. If the school was not full, if\\r\\n\\n\\nthe school-bills were punctually paid, if no offence had been given or\\r\\n\\n\\ntaken, why in the name of wonder should the school mistress decline to\\r\\n\\n\\nreceive back into her charge a profitable pupil.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madam,” he said, rising to go, “I cannot demand an explanation of your\\r\\n\\n\\nrefusal to receive my ward—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I would rather not give one, sir,” interrupted the lady, forgetting\\r\\n\\n\\nin her haste that it was not courteous to cut short a gentleman’s words,\\r\\n\\n\\nand that she herself would have rebuked any pupil of her school for\\r\\n\\n\\ndoing such a thing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I was about to say, Madam, that I could not demand such an explanation\\r\\n\\n\\nas a right, but that I would ask it as a favor. I will take Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling back to the carriage and return here immediately if you will be\\r\\n\\n\\nso kind as to await me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, sir—” commenced the lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander only bowed low in response, took the hand of Drusilla and drew\\r\\n\\n\\nit under his arm and led her from the room and the house, and placed her\\r\\n\\n\\nin the carriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe told the coachman to stop there, and then he went back to the parlor,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere he found the principal of the school still waiting.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madam,” he commenced, gravely but courteously standing before her,\\r\\n\\n\\n“there is something more in your refusal to receive my ward than\\r\\n\\n\\nappears. I respectfully ask you to tell me what it is.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I entreat you, sir, as you are a gentleman, not to press the\\r\\n\\n\\nquestion,” said Miss Irving very coldly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Believe me, Madam, if I only were concerned I would press no unwelcome\\r\\n\\n\\nquestion upon any lady; but this is the case of an orphan girl who, for\\r\\n\\n\\nno fault of hers, has received a mortifying repulse. Forgive me if I\\r\\n\\n\\nstill must press for an explanation.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sit down, sir, and if you must have it, I do not think Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling a fit or proper associate for the young ladies who are under my\\r\\n\\n\\ncare.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madam! Is it possible that in a democratic country like this, the mere\\r\\n\\n\\nfact that a young girl happens to be the daughter of a respectable\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper should exclude her from the school where young ladies are\\r\\n\\n\\neducated? Consider; her mother, though in some sort a domestic servant,\\r\\n\\n\\nwas still a most respectable person, the widow of a Baptist preacher,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Alexander, with ill suppressed vexation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, it is not the girl’s position, but her character, that is so\\r\\n\\n\\nobjectionable.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“MADAM!” exclaimed Alexander, firing up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have, by forcing me to an explanation, sir, brought all this\\r\\n\\n\\nunpleasantness upon yourself. I would willingly have spared my own\\r\\n\\n\\nfeelings and yours by keeping silent,” said the lady, very gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madam, you have now said too much not to say more. Who is it that dares\\r\\n\\n\\nto question the blameless character of my young ward?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Common rumor, sir!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Common rumor!” exclaimed the young man, starting up. Then controlling\\r\\n\\n\\nhis excited passion, and re-seating himself, he inquired grimly—“What is\\r\\n\\n\\nthe nature of this injurious rumor?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Her name is associated with yours in a manner that must be fatal to the\\r\\n\\n\\nreputation of any young girl.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander stared blankly at the lady for a moment, and then exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Heaven and earth, Madam, what is it that you mean?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, it is not courteous to cross-question me in this manner,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Irving, blushing between embarrassment and anger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not courteous! Am I to be on courteous terms with one who is\\r\\n\\n\\nstabbing.—Madam, if you were not a woman—But let that pass. I now\\r\\n\\n\\n_insist_ upon knowing what you mean by saying that Drusilla Sterling’s\\r\\n\\n\\nspotless name is associated with mine in a manner that must be fatal to\\r\\n\\n\\nher,” indignantly exclaimed Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is said, then, that you are her favored lover, with no intention of\\r\\n\\n\\nbecoming her husband,” coldly and curtly answered the lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Heaven of Heavens!” exclaimed the young man, starting up and striding\\r\\n\\n\\nacross the room in his excitement, “was ever such an infamous\\r\\n\\n\\ncalumny!—Your author, Madam! I demand to know your author!” he at length\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, standing before her, pale with fury.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I said common rumor,” quietly replied Mrs. Irving.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, but that will not do! Common rumor is an irresponsible thing. I\\r\\n\\n\\nmust have your author—one who can be called to account, and made to\\r\\n\\n\\nswallow the calumny, though it should choke the calumniator.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, sir, I fear you will have to call my whole school, with its\\r\\n\\n\\npatrons behind it, to account. For this rumor came in with the pupils\\r\\n\\n\\nwho returned to the school after the Christmas holidays. They heard it\\r\\n\\n\\nat their homes, or in the social circles of the city where it was spoken\\r\\n\\n\\nof. Of course, when this report came to the knowledge of the teachers,\\r\\n\\n\\nthey severely rebuked their pupils for such sort of conversation. I know\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing of the truth or falsehood of this report; it is quite enough\\r\\n\\n\\nthat such exists to banish its subject, guilty or innocent, from young\\r\\n\\n\\nladies’ society.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander resumed his hurried walk to and fro in the room in much\\r\\n\\n\\ndistress of mind. Then, pausing once more before the lady, he said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madam, I am wounded to the quick by these cruel and fatal slanders. But\\r\\n\\n\\nwould it not have been more womanly, more Christian in you to have\\r\\n\\n\\ndefended the good name of that innocent girl and friendless\\r\\n\\n\\norphan?—Friendless, but for my friendship, which seems to have been her\\r\\n\\n\\nbane.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, you must please to remember that my position as the principal of a\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung ladies’ academy is a peculiar one. Had I even known your ward to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe blameless, I could not, in the face of such reports, have received\\r\\n\\n\\nher without breaking up my school. Every pupil would have been removed\\r\\n\\n\\nby her friends, nor could I have blamed them. I regret to have pained\\r\\n\\n\\nyou; but please also to remember that you brought this pain upon\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself by insisting on an explanation.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I was right! And I will drag the foul slander farther into the\\r\\n\\n\\nlight. _Some_ one originated it, and I will make it my first business to\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscover and punish the originator. Good morning, Madam.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd with a very ceremonious bow Alexander Lyon left the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen he entered the carriage, and seated himself by Drusilla’s side, she\\r\\n\\n\\nturned to him with a sweet, bright confiding look, that smote him to the\\r\\n\\n\\nheart.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, do not smile on me so, my child! I have been too thoughtless of\\r\\n\\n\\nyour good. But you shall have justice—full justice—grand justice! By the\\r\\n\\n\\nheavens above, you shall, cost it what it may!” he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked at him now in much distress, and faltered forth the question:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will you tell me what has so disturbed you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe reflected for a moment, and then answered firmly, though kindly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_No_, Drusilla—not for the world. To tell you would be to wrong you.\\r\\n\\n\\nTrust in me, my child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I do, I do, as I trust in heaven!” she answered, fervently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I will never betray that innocent trust, and may the Lord deal with\\r\\n\\n\\nme as I shall deal with you, my child!” he said, reverently lifting his\\r\\n\\n\\nhat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the meantime the carriage, bowling along at a rapid rate, brought\\r\\n\\n\\nthem back to the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have forborne to ask me what passed in my interview with the school\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress, (Satan fly away with her!” he muttered between his teeth,)\\r\\n\\n\\n“and you have done well. If the conversation had been proper for you to\\r\\n\\n\\nhear, I should have repeated it to you,” said Alexander, as they entered\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I trust in you,” Drusilla replied, as she bowed her head, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nwent up stairs to take off her bonnet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander Lyon went into the morning sitting-room and rang the bell, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthen dropped, half dead with trouble, into his leathern arm-chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Dorset answered the summons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come here—close to me,” said the young man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Dorset; perplexed and disturbed by the looks and manners of his\\r\\n\\n\\nmaster, approached.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dorset, you are an old, faithful and very discreet servant,” commenced\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDorset bowed humbly and silently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I wish to speak to you upon a very delicate subject, which I would not\\r\\n\\n\\nname to any other person in the house, or even to you, except under the\\r\\n\\n\\nmost urgent necessity. Dorset——” He paused, as if he found the greatest\\r\\n\\n\\ndifficulty in proceeding. And Dorset bowed again, and waited in\\r\\n\\n\\nrespectful attention. “Dorset,” he resumed, “while Miss Sterling has\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen in this house, have you heard any rumor prejudicial to her good\\r\\n\\n\\nname?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old servant bowed his head upon his breast, and remained in a deep\\r\\n\\n\\nsilence of grief and mortification.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is enough!” said the young man, grimly; “your silence is more\\r\\n\\n\\neloquent than words. But now open your mouth and speak, to tell me who\\r\\n\\n\\nstarted these reports, for, by the father of lies, I swear to visit them\\r\\n\\n\\nheavily upon the head of the slanderer!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old servant shook his gray locks slowly and sadly, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, my dear master! in that case, I fear, you would have to punish the\\r\\n\\n\\ndead, and I scarcely believe that you would do that if you could, or\\r\\n\\n\\ncould do it if you would.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean, old man?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, sir, you might almost guess. The report started with that poor, mad\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman’s fancies about you having married her daughter.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander sprang from his chair, struck his forehead, and then sinking\\r\\n\\n\\ninto his seat again, murmured:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I might have foreseen this; I ought to have foreseen it when I humored\\r\\n\\n\\nand almost encouraged the poor creature in her illusions. But how did\\r\\n\\n\\nthis get out?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, it was in this way: her church friends came to see her, and\\r\\n\\n\\nshe babbled to them about your fancied marriage with her daughter,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich, of course, none of them believed. If you remember, sir, in\\r\\n\\n\\nspeaking of the poor woman’s death, I told you she died easy and not too\\r\\n\\n\\nsoon, for that she had grown more and more foolish every day. It seemed\\r\\n\\n\\nheartless to say so, sir, but indeed it was true; for from babbling of\\r\\n\\n\\nyour marriage with her daughter, she got to babbling about your wronging\\r\\n\\n\\nof her daughter, in the very worst way a gentleman could wrong a young\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good heavens! was ever such a fatal calamity?” cried Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\nstarting up and pacing the room in great excitement. “Oh, my child! my\\r\\n\\n\\nchild! my lamb! my dove! my dear, dear Drusilla! Go on, old man! go on!\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat next?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, they to whom she babbled believed this last lie, and took it into\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir addled heads that the mother’s madness was caused by the\\r\\n\\n\\ndaughter’s ruin, and went and reported as they believed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Who_ were they?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Women, sir, more the pity! women of the church—old women who came to\\r\\n\\n\\ntake tea and talk scandal with the housekeeper.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And did Drusilla—did my poor child hear all this?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think not, sir. Mad as the mother was, she had sense enough left to\\r\\n\\n\\nsend her daughter out of the room whenever she was about to babble. No,\\r\\n\\n\\nsir; I feel sure Miss Drusilla knows nothing about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank heaven for that! She shall never know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“These reports, sir, caused me, in writing to you of the housekeeper’s\\r\\n\\n\\ndeath, to ask you what should be done with Miss Drusilla; for I knew\\r\\n\\n\\nthat this house was no longer a proper home for her, as I took the\\r\\n\\n\\nliberty of hinting to you, sir; for though Molly and myself and indeed\\r\\n\\n\\nall the servants, did all we could to put a stop to these rumors, we\\r\\n\\n\\ncould not succeed in doing it. And so, sir,” repeated the old man, “I\\r\\n\\n\\nmade so bold as to ask you what should be done with Miss Drusilla.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know NOW what shall be done with her. SHE SHALL BE MARRIED!” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander Lyon, grimly. “And now, Dorset, you may go; and remember, not\\r\\n\\n\\none word of this interview to any living creature!” he added.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Surely not, sir,” said the old man, bowing himself out of the room, and\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch wondering, if Miss Drusilla was to be married, where Mr. Lyon meant\\r\\n\\n\\nto find her a husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                           JOY FOR DRUSILLA.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           Joy trickled in her tears, joy filled the sob\\r\\n\\n\\n           That rocked her heart till almost heard to throb;\\r\\n\\n\\n           And paradise was breathing in the sigh\\r\\n\\n\\n           Of nature’s child, in nature’s ecstacy.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile Alexander Lyon paced the floor of his study, trembling with shame\\r\\n\\n\\nand anger, Drusilla sat in her little chamber, smiling with delight. The\\r\\n\\n\\nsame event that thrilled his soul with a sense of wrong and\\r\\n\\n\\nmortification, filled her heart with joy. She was not to go back to\\r\\n\\n\\nschool. She was to stay home with him; and this was all sufficient to\\r\\n\\n\\nher happiness. She neither knew, nor guessed, nor cared why she had been\\r\\n\\n\\ndeclined, as a pupil by Mrs. Irving. She had a vague impression that the\\r\\n\\n\\nschool was full, or the staff of teachers incomplete; but she was too\\r\\n\\n\\nentirely absorbed in the happy thought of being at home for good with\\r\\n\\n\\nhim, to speculate about the reason why she was so.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDuring the last twelve months, while in attendance upon her late\\r\\n\\n\\nbenefactress, and also while with her lost mother, Drusilla had had the\\r\\n\\n\\nentire charge of Alexander’s wardrobe. To keep it in perfect order was\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her a labor of love. So, on this morning, when she was so\\r\\n\\n\\nunexpectedly and joyfully reprieved from banishment, she sat down with\\r\\n\\n\\nher little work-basket beside her, and occupied the hours in darning\\r\\n\\n\\nsmall holes in silk and lambs-wool socks; and so neatly she darned, that\\r\\n\\n\\nit would have required sharp eyes to have found out where the recent\\r\\n\\n\\nrents had been. She worked and sang at her work, for her heart was\\r\\n\\n\\noverflowing with happiness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh! even her mother was for the moment forgotten.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLate in the afternoon she was sent for to join Mr. Lyon at dinner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe merely smoothed her hair and put on a fresh collar and pair of\\r\\n\\n\\ncuffs, and then went down into the dining-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere had always been kindness and gentleness in his manner to her. But\\r\\n\\n\\nnow, as he arose to meet her, there was a tenderness in his expression\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she had never seen before.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My poor child! You are smiling; I really believe you are glad to be\\r\\n\\n\\nback at home,” he said, as he placed her in her chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed I am, very glad,” answered Drusilla, truthfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, then—so am I,” said Alexander, smiling on her; and then adding,\\r\\n\\n\\nin a lower tone—“It is fate; who can resist it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe helped her to the most delicate morsels, from each dish. And to\\r\\n\\n\\nplease him she tried to eat a little; but, in truth, joy as surely takes\\r\\n\\n\\nappetite away as grief does; and added to her joy in being at home was a\\r\\n\\n\\nstrange, vague presentiment of something about to happen, something\\r\\n\\n\\nimminent and momentous. All the spiritual atmosphere around her seemed\\r\\n\\n\\nas full of this, as the air before a storm is full of electricity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander ate no more than she did. And neither spoke often or much.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length, when they had lingered some time over the dessert, he arose\\r\\n\\n\\nand said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My child, are you too shy to withdraw, and are you waiting for me to\\r\\n\\n\\ndismiss you? Go, then, into the drawing-room, and presently I will come\\r\\n\\n\\nto you there, and you shall give me a cup of tea,” and so saying he\\r\\n\\n\\nopened the door, and held it open for her to pass out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Alexander—you _are_ glad I am not going back to school, are you\\r\\n\\n\\nnot?” she inquired, doubtfully and anxiously, as she paused in the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoorway and raised her beautiful beseeching eyes to his face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes! by all my hopes of happiness, I am glad!” he suddenly exclaimed;\\r\\n\\n\\nand then he added—(“I am always glad to have my fate decided for me,”)\\r\\n\\n\\nand then again laughing lightly, he said—“There, go away, little love! I\\r\\n\\n\\nwill join you presently.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla went to the drawing-room; but she did not sit down; she walked\\r\\n\\n\\nslowly up and down the room, strangely perturbed by that presentiment,\\r\\n\\n\\nof which she could not yet know whether it was to be one of joy or great\\r\\n\\n\\nwoe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander remained in the dining-room alone; not drinking wine, or\\r\\n\\n\\nsmoking cigars; neither of these small vices affected him. He was simply\\r\\n\\n\\ntrying to commune with himself; a difficult task to one so unused to\\r\\n\\n\\nself-examination as Mr. Lyon. He had always loved his beautiful pet,\\r\\n\\n\\nmore than he had ever loved any other living creature; and always, as he\\r\\n\\n\\nsupposed, in a fatherly, or elder brotherly sort of fashion. But lately\\r\\n\\n\\nthis pure love had burst forth into a fierce passion. From the hour in\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich he had soothed her sorrow, and hushed her to rest on his bosom,\\r\\n\\n\\nand gazed on her sleeping beauty, he had longed to make that beauty his\\r\\n\\n\\nown forever. True, from the very first, he had combatted this passion.\\r\\n\\n\\nFrom the very moment that he found himself contemplating the beautiful\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl with other feelings than became the brotherly love he professed for\\r\\n\\n\\nher, he put her from his arms, and tried to put her from his heart, and\\r\\n\\n\\nmade arrangements for placing her entirely out of his sight and out of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis way, in the safe refuge of her school. How and why she was rejected\\r\\n\\n\\nby the principal of that school, the reader already knows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe very fact of rejection threw her back upon his hands, while the\\r\\n\\n\\ncause of it appealed to his manhood in her behalf.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen sinners can find no other excuse for sin, they plead fate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, sitting and gazing dreamily into the lights and shadows of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis glowing coal fire, said to himself that fate had set itself against\\r\\n\\n\\nhis union with Anna, and fate had thrown Drusilla into his arms. He\\r\\n\\n\\nrecalled the facts that his wedding with Anna, twice fixed, had been\\r\\n\\n\\ntwice stopped by the hand of death; that Anna did not love him, and did\\r\\n\\n\\nlove Richard Hammond: that he himself did not love Anna, but loved\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla; that Drusilla loved him, and had most innocently suffered\\r\\n\\n\\nreproach and injury on his account; that he had striven to overcome his\\r\\n\\n\\npassion for the beautiful orphan, even to the extent of taking her to\\r\\n\\n\\nschool with the full intention of leaving her there, but that she had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen repulsed and thrown back upon his charge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe had decided that in all this was the irresistible hand of fate. This\\r\\n\\n\\nand many other arguments he used to persuade himself that it would be\\r\\n\\n\\naltogether right for him to give up his cousin Anna, and take to his\\r\\n\\n\\nbosom the beautiful orphan Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd this would have been right, if he had only chosen to do it in the\\r\\n\\n\\nright way. If he had written to his betrothed and told _her_ all that he\\r\\n\\n\\ntold _himself_, there is no doubt that she would have gladly released\\r\\n\\n\\nhim from his engagement; and then if he had asked Drusilla to be his\\r\\n\\n\\nwife, and had married her in the face of all the world, his course would\\r\\n\\n\\nhave been upright and honorable. But he did none of these things.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander Lyon was proud, and he wished to satisfy his love, without\\r\\n\\n\\nsacrificing his pride, so he resolved that his marriage with the late\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper’s daughter, should be a strictly secret one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHaving made up his mind, he arose and walked into the drawing-room,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere he found Drusilla still slowly pacing up and down the floor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, you restless little creature! One would think your thoughts had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen as perturbed as my own. Come, now! tell me truly, what you are\\r\\n\\n\\ndreaming of,” said Alexander, possessing himself of her hand, and\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing her down by his side on the sofa.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSomething in his look and manner, something that she had never seen\\r\\n\\n\\nthere before, startled and almost terrified her. For the first time, in\\r\\n\\n\\nall their association, a swift, hot blush swept over her face and neck,\\r\\n\\n\\ncrimsoning both, so that Alexander, already half mad with love, thought\\r\\n\\n\\nher more beautiful and bewitching than ever.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come now! of what were you thinking?” he persisted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, I do not know; I have forgotten;—of nothing, I believe; I was\\r\\n\\n\\nnot thinking; I was—trembling,” faltered the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Trembling, my darling? Why should you tremble? No evil shall come near\\r\\n\\n\\nyou while I live,” said Alexander, tenderly. “Come, tell me why you were\\r\\n\\n\\ntrembling?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It was—but you will laugh at me?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, indeed, my sweet——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It was with a sort of presentiment that oppressed me,” said Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nin a tone deepened with awe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A humming-bird is said to tremble before an approaching storm, though\\r\\n\\n\\nno cloud be in the sky. You are as sensitive as a humming-bird, my pet;\\r\\n\\n\\ndo you tremble at an approaching storm?” smiled Alexander, gently\\r\\n\\n\\ncaressing her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor the first time in her life, she shrank from him, yet immediately\\r\\n\\n\\nwondered at and reproached herself for doing so.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, my love, is it a good or evil presentiment that overawes you so?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do not know even _that_ much. I have felt all the evening as if\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething was hanging over me—I cannot tell what. Yes, the air is full\\r\\n\\n\\nof electricity,” she said, and stopped and shuddered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My child, superstitious people say that dreams and presentiments go by\\r\\n\\n\\ncontraries. If you dream of a death, it is a sign of a wedding; if you\\r\\n\\n\\nhave a foreboding of evil, it is a sign some good is about to happen to\\r\\n\\n\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I do not know whether _my_ foreboding is of good or evil,” she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, softly smiling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will tell you, then, my darling. It is of _both_, since it\\r\\n\\n\\nforeshadows love and marriage, Drusilla,” he answered, gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe started slightly, shrank a little, and raised her eyes timidly to\\r\\n\\n\\nhis face, but dropped them instantly, and blushed beneath the ardent\\r\\n\\n\\ngaze with which he was regarding her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla,” he said, panting and speaking low, “do you know how I love\\r\\n\\n\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHad he asked her this question a week before, speaking in his usual\\r\\n\\n\\ntone, she would have answered him promptly and sweetly and calmly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut now she only trembled very much, without being able to utter a word.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do you know how I love you, Drusilla?” he panted low, stealing his arm\\r\\n\\n\\naround her waist.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, don’t, sir! please don’t!” gasped the girl, frightened at his\\r\\n\\n\\ncaress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t what, my darling?” he whispered, drawing her closer to his heart.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, don’t! let me go, please!” she faltered, gently trying to free\\r\\n\\n\\nherself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Don’t let you go, please!’ I don’t intend to, my beautiful darling,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Alexander, passionately pressing his lips to hers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt that moment the door was pushed gently open by Dorset, who entered\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the tea tray, and stood still in astonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What the—?—What do you want here?” angrily demanded Alexander barely\\r\\n\\n\\nable to repress an oath, as he saw Dorset and hastily released Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir, it is the tea tray,” said the old man, in growing\\r\\n\\n\\nwonder.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hang the tea tray! What do you mean by bringing it here before it is\\r\\n\\n\\nwanted?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beg pardon, sir, but it is nine o’clock, when I allers brings it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then why don’t you knock before entering a room? You servants are\\r\\n\\n\\nperfect vandals in your rudeness.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please, sir, I never was used to knock in the old Madam’s time, so I\\r\\n\\n\\ndid not know as I was expected to do it now; but beg pardon, sir, I will\\r\\n\\n\\nallers knock for the future.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Put the tray down and go.—No, stay and wait,” growled Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\nbeginning to feel conscious that if his kiss was an indiscretion, his\\r\\n\\n\\nfuss with the old man’s interruption of it was a still greater one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDorset obediently sat the tray down on the table, arranged the tea\\r\\n\\n\\nservice, bowed, and stood waiting.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, my little daughter, you must preside,” said Alexander, trying\\r\\n\\n\\nto give a paternal aspect to his affection for the orphan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, blushing deeply, took her place at the table and poured out\\r\\n\\n\\nthe tea.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander purposely kept his old servant in waiting until they had\\r\\n\\n\\nfinished. Then he bid Dorset remove the service.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs soon as he found himself alone with Drusilla, he saw that the girl\\r\\n\\n\\nwas trembling excessively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t be alarmed, dear love, and don’t distrust me,” he said, drawing\\r\\n\\n\\nhis chair beside her. “I asked you just now if you knew how I loved you.\\r\\n\\n\\nYou did not reply, but I will answer the question for you. No, Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nyou don’t know how I love, for I love you so much that I wish to make\\r\\n\\n\\nyou my own forever and ever. Drusilla, you must be my wife, never to be\\r\\n\\n\\nparted from me again.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked up in his face, her arched brows, dilated eyes and parted\\r\\n\\n\\nlips expressing amazement, delight, and even terror.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You will be my wife, Drusilla?” he whispered, drawing her towards him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then her overwrought heart found relief in tears, and she wept\\r\\n\\n\\nfreely on his bosom. When at length she ceased to sob, and grew quiet,\\r\\n\\n\\nhe bent his head down to hers and whispered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All this means ‘yes,’ does it not, my own?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—but—Miss Anna!” murmured the girl, scarcely trusting her voice to\\r\\n\\n\\nspeak.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Miss Anna——” He nearly uttered an oath consigning his cousin to\\r\\n\\n\\nperdition, but he caught himself in time, and added: “Miss Anna and\\r\\n\\n\\nmyself are parted (by a hundred miles of space,”) was his mental\\r\\n\\n\\nreservation the first.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She has broken with you, then?” said Drusilla, who never dreamed of\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch a possibility as _his_ breaking faith with any one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, she has, (in effect,”) was his mental reservation the second.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, how could—how could she do it?” inquired Drusilla, incredulously;\\r\\n\\n\\nfor to her fond, worshipping heart, it seemed that any woman who could\\r\\n\\n\\nbreak faith with Alexander must be insane or lost.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She loves Richard Hammond’s little finger more than she does my\\r\\n\\n\\nimmortal soul! (Come that is wholly true, at all events,”) he added\\r\\n\\n\\nmentally.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you are grieved at this?” murmured the girl, mournfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I! I grieved at it? I never was so glad of anything in my life! My\\r\\n\\n\\nchild, I never loved Anna except as a cousin. She never loved me in any\\r\\n\\n\\nother than a cousinly way. We were betrothed by our parents—a sure\\r\\n\\n\\nprocess to prevent our ever falling in love with each other. Ours was to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe ‘a union of hands and a union of lands,’ but not ‘a union of hearts.’\\r\\n\\n\\nWe really never wished to marry each other. She loved Richard as well as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe can love anybody, and I—I love you as I never loved any other. Come,\\r\\n\\n\\nmy darling, you are to be mine forever.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But Mr. Alexander—a poor girl like myself—your late housekeeper’s\\r\\n\\n\\nchild—only half educated, too—I am not fit to be your wife,” she said,\\r\\n\\n\\nraising her meek eyes to his face, and then suddenly dropping them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not fit to be my wife! If you are not, it is only because you are so\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch too good for me!” vehemently exclaimed Drusilla’s lover, and he\\r\\n\\n\\nspoke the truth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh no! Oh no! please do not say such things to me. I am but a poor,\\r\\n\\n\\nignorant child, of very humble position. You are a gentleman of rank and\\r\\n\\n\\nwealth. Indeed, sir, it is not suitable——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla! You do not love me!” he exclaimed, as if he had been charging\\r\\n\\n\\nher with a great sin.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA year before, she would have thrown her arms around his neck, and amid\\r\\n\\n\\ntears and caresses, she would have assured him that she loved him more\\r\\n\\n\\nthan all others on earth. But she could make no such protestations now,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough her love for him had in this year grown and strengthened, until\\r\\n\\n\\nit absorbed her whole being. She could only raise a quick and quickly\\r\\n\\n\\nwithdrawn deprecating glance to his face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, that means that you do love me a little. If so, let me be the\\r\\n\\n\\njudge of your fitness to be my wife,” he said, looking tenderly down on\\r\\n\\n\\nher bowed face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know you must be the best judge,” she meekly admitted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, it is a settled thing. You are to be my own,” he whispered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you think that a poor girl like myself can comfort you for the loss\\r\\n\\n\\nof Miss Anna—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bosh! I beg your pardon, little love. But I don’t need comfort for the\\r\\n\\n\\nloss of Miss Anna. I require congratulations rather. Didn’t I tell you\\r\\n\\n\\nthat I never was so glad of anything in my life? And didn’t I give you\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf a dozen reasons of being glad of it? I want you to be my love and\\r\\n\\n\\njoy. Come, darling, will you be my wife? Try to answer—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe stooped and whispered—\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will be anything you wish me to. If you should tell me to go and be a\\r\\n\\n\\nnun, I would go and be one.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was not more than half pleased with this answer, which he did not\\r\\n\\n\\nunderstand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So you only consent to marry me because I ask you to do it; and not\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause you love me, or because to do so would make you happy?” he\\r\\n\\n\\nasked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAgain her shy, soft eyes were lifted to his face with a pleading glance\\r\\n\\n\\nand then cast down.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Answer me, Drusa,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It would make me happy to do anything you should ask me to do; for I\\r\\n\\n\\nlove to feel that I belong to you, to do your bidding; and that you have\\r\\n\\n\\na right to dispose of me as you please,” she murmured, in a very low and\\r\\n\\n\\ntimid tone, hesitating and blushing to utter her own pure thoughts.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This is devotion, this is submission, but it may not be the love that\\r\\n\\n\\nmakes happiness. Drusilla, apart from all this—your pleasure in pleasing\\r\\n\\n\\nme. Will it make you in yourself happy to be my wife and spend your\\r\\n\\n\\nwhole life by my side?” he earnestly inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As happy as an angel in Heaven,” she aspirated, in a low and fervent\\r\\n\\n\\ntone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe caught her closer to his bosom and pressed her there; he pressed\\r\\n\\n\\nkisses on her lips, her cheeks, her brow; he called her by every\\r\\n\\n\\nendearing name——\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere came a gentle, discreet knock at the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well! Who’s there? Come in!” said Mr. Alexander impatiently, as he\\r\\n\\n\\ngently put Drusilla off his knee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe door opened and Dorset appeared.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What now? I really believe you are wantonly trying my temper!”\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir, I thought maybe you had retired, and I came to rake\\r\\n\\n\\nout the fire and turn off the gas, as usual, before going to bed\\r\\n\\n\\nmyself.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What! at _this_ hour?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beg pardon, sir, but this is the usual hour.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander looked up at the clock on the mantle-piece, and saw with\\r\\n\\n\\nsurprise, that it was past eleven.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My little daughter, I have kept you up too late. You must go to rest\\r\\n\\n\\nnow. Good night,” he said, taking a bedroom candle from the side table,\\r\\n\\n\\nlighting it, and putting it in the hands of Drusilla, who immediately\\r\\n\\n\\nwithdrew.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe went to her room in a delirium of joy, every nerve thrilling, heart\\r\\n\\n\\nbeating, brain whirling with joy. To be Alexander’s wife! It was a\\r\\n\\n\\nHeaven of Heavens she had never dreamed of. She dropped on her knees\\r\\n\\n\\nbeside her bed, and fervently thanked God for her great happiness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                         A REALLY HAPPY BRIDE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n          How beautiful she looked, her conscious heart\\r\\n\\n\\n          Glowed in her cheek and yet she felt no wrong.\\r\\n\\n\\n          Oh, love, how perfect thy majestic art,\\r\\n\\n\\n          Strengthening the weak and trampling on the strong!\\r\\n\\n\\n          How self-deceitful is the sages’ part\\r\\n\\n\\n          Of mortals whom thy art hath led along.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nI said that joy takes away the appetite as surely as grief does; and joy\\r\\n\\n\\nas well as grief banishes repose. Drusilla lay awake, in a happy\\r\\n\\n\\nreverie, until near morning, when she fell into fitful slumbers that\\r\\n\\n\\nsoon deepened into dreamless sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was late in the forenoon when she awoke.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh! how many of us have awakened from such deep insensibility to the\\r\\n\\n\\nconsciousness of some heavy but undefined and half-forgotten woe, that\\r\\n\\n\\nall too soon takes shape and distinctness to confront and overwhelm us!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, on the contrary, awoke in the golden mist of some great but\\r\\n\\n\\nvague joy, that soon shaped itself into the thought that she was to be\\r\\n\\n\\nthe wife of one she loved more than her own soul, and only less than her\\r\\n\\n\\nGod.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut such exultation of the spirit seldom lasts long.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore the girl had finished her simple morning toilet, her joy was sunk\\r\\n\\n\\nin remorseful tenderness that she could rejoice in anything so soon\\r\\n\\n\\nafter her poor mother’s death. And she wept; but though less exultant,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was scarcely less happy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe went down into the morning sitting-room. Alexander had waited for\\r\\n\\n\\nher, because he would not breakfast without her. He met her with a\\r\\n\\n\\nradiant smile, and he welcomed her with a warm embrace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter breakfast, he spoke to her of his plans for the future. He told\\r\\n\\n\\nher that he wished their marriage to take place almost immediately.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe timidly expressed her feelings on this subject; the equal pain she\\r\\n\\n\\nwould feel in opposing his wishes on the one hand, or, in marrying so\\r\\n\\n\\nsoon after her mother’s death on the other.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But why should you feel pain at the thought of marrying so soon after\\r\\n\\n\\nyour poor mother’s death, my darling?” tenderly inquired her lover.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It would seem heartless; it would seem disrespectful to her memory?”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid the orphan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not at all, my love. Daughters are sometimes, when expedient, married\\r\\n\\n\\neven beside the death-beds of their mothers. You have heard or read of\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch cases?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then why should you feel any scruple in marrying, if expedient, within\\r\\n\\n\\na few weeks after your dear mother’s decease?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But _is_ it expedient?” she inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is more. It is absolutely necessary. We must immediately marry,\\r\\n\\n\\nor——PART.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis last word struck her like a shot, as he intended that it should.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe started, drew back, and gazed at him in consternation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, my innocent, ignorant child, does it not occur to you that it\\r\\n\\n\\nwould be wrong for you, a young girl, and I, a young man, to live alone\\r\\n\\n\\ntogether, or with only servants in the house, unless we were married?”\\r\\n\\n\\nhe gravely inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe flushed crimson over face and neck, but had no word to reply.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, we must be married immediately,” he said, firmly, striking\\r\\n\\n\\n“while the iron was hot.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—so soon after my poor mother’s death. To be made so happy, when I\\r\\n\\n\\nought to be weeping for her,” faltered the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My darling, you shall weep for a year if you like, so that you weep in\\r\\n\\n\\nmy arms, and give me a legal right to hold you there. Come, Drusilla! If\\r\\n\\n\\nour wedding were going to be a gay one, with fine dresses, and fine\\r\\n\\n\\ncompany and festivities, you might, indeed, object that it would be\\r\\n\\n\\nshowing disrespect to your mother’s memory. But I propose that our\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding shall be a very very quiet one, as quiet as if it were\\r\\n\\n\\nsolemnized at a death-bed. Come, what do you say to that?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Alexander, I know you would not lead me into the least departure\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom the duty I owe to the memory of my dear, lost mother. Decide for\\r\\n\\n\\nme, Mr. Alexander,” she said very sweetly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I will. But leave out the ‘Mr.,’ my darling. I do not like the\\r\\n\\n\\nformality of that word from your sweet lips. Shall I decide for you in\\r\\n\\n\\n_all_ things, my pet?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In all things, yes. Whom have I in the world but you?” she said,\\r\\n\\n\\nlifting her dove-like eyes confidingly to his face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No one indeed—thank heaven!” exclaimed Alexander, with triumph in the\\r\\n\\n\\nthought of how entirely this delicate, helpless, dependent child lay in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis power and at his mercy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe thought should have awakened his magnanimity; but, unhappily, it\\r\\n\\n\\nonly flattered his selfishness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe did decide all things for her. He decided that their marriage should\\r\\n\\n\\nbe a strictly secret one; and he gave her plausible reasons why it must\\r\\n\\n\\nbe so; but she needed for this, no other reason than his will. He\\r\\n\\n\\ndecided that the house in Richmond was too gloomy in its associations of\\r\\n\\n\\ninsanity, illness, and death, for their habitation, and that they should\\r\\n\\n\\ngo to Washington to spend the winter. And he arranged that he himself\\r\\n\\n\\nshould go in advance to the capital city and secure a home; and that on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe receipt of a certain letter which he should write, she should\\r\\n\\n\\nsecretly leave the house and join him in Washington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTo all this Drusilla readily agreed. In the fulness of her faith she had\\r\\n\\n\\nplaced her fate in his hands and left it there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis plan was carried out. The same day he told his old servant that\\r\\n\\n\\nurgent business called him away from home, and that he should leave for\\r\\n\\n\\nBaltimore the next morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDorset, prompt and punctual, had his master’s portmanteau packed and his\\r\\n\\n\\nbreakfast on the table by eight o’clock.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Mr. Alexander left Richmond by the nine o’clock train for Baltimore,\\r\\n\\n\\nintending to take the next day’s train from the latter city to\\r\\n\\n\\nWashington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla knew that she could not hear from him for three or four days,\\r\\n\\n\\nso she waited three days and then went to the post-office, where, for\\r\\n\\n\\ngreater secrecy, her letters were to be left until called for. Here she\\r\\n\\n\\nfound a letter—the first genuine love letter she had ever received. She\\r\\n\\n\\nhad, from childhood, written many letters to Alexander, and received\\r\\n\\n\\nmany from him—all, his and hers, filled with love, but not such love as\\r\\n\\n\\nthis. Drusilla eagerly read it over in the office, and then, “all on\\r\\n\\n\\nfire with joy,” she hurried home and locked herself in her own room, to\\r\\n\\n\\nfeast on her letter undisturbed and at leisure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEvery day she went to the post-office, and every day she received one of\\r\\n\\n\\nthese ardent outpourings of love.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander had been absent about ten days, when one morning on inquiry,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe received a letter that summoned her at once to Washington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThat night Drusilla quietly packed her carpet bag with a few\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessaries, and before day the next morning she slipped out of the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse and took the early train for Washington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe train reached Alexandria early in the afternoon, and Drusilla found\\r\\n\\n\\nher lover on the platform at the station.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, dear love,” he said, “I have a carriage waiting. We must be\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried in this town, and then I will take you to Washington.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn a flutter of delight and embarrassment she let him take her from the\\r\\n\\n\\ntrain and place her in the carriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe told the coachman to drive to Duke street, and as soon as the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage was in motion, he caught his bride in his arms and pressed her\\r\\n\\n\\nto his bosom, amid the fondest caresses and tenderest words of\\r\\n\\n\\nendearment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was interrupted at length by the stopping of the coach, and the voice\\r\\n\\n\\nof the coachman inquiring:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where in Duke Street am I to drive, if you please, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To the Reverend Mr. Hopper’s—the new Methodist preacher’s,” replied\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd a few more turns of the wheels brought the carriage to the house\\r\\n\\n\\nindicated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander lifted his trembling companion to the sidewalk, and then led\\r\\n\\n\\nher up the steps to the door of Mr. Hopper’s residence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA servant answered his knock, and showed him into a plainly furnished\\r\\n\\n\\nparlor, where sat the preacher and the family, dressed in their Sunday’s\\r\\n\\n\\nbest, and apparently waiting the bridal pair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Hopper arose at once and shook hands with the bridegroom, and\\r\\n\\n\\npresented him to his—the preacher’s—mother and sisters.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, in turn, presented his bride to the ladies of the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen, as no time was to be lost, the young pair stood up side by side;\\r\\n\\n\\nthe ladies of the party arranged themselves as attendants and witnesses,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the ceremony that made Alexander Lyon and Drusilla Sterling man and\\r\\n\\n\\nwife was performed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the blessing had been pronounced, Alexander saluted his\\r\\n\\n\\n“child-wife” with the almost reverential tenderness due to her sacred\\r\\n\\n\\nisolation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe preacher shook hands with both and wished them much joy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen the ladies of the family came up with their congratulations.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old lady kissed the youthful bride with much feeling, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“May the Lord bless you, poor, motherless little thing!—And you, sir,”\\r\\n\\n\\nshe added, turning to the bridegroom—“Remember that her extreme youth\\r\\n\\n\\nand her recent orphanage claim a double amount of tenderness.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know it, madam; I feel it; and I thank you for the interest you take\\r\\n\\n\\nin my little wife,” said Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe then slipped a hundred dollar note in the preacher’s hand, bowed his\\r\\n\\n\\nadieux to the whole party, and led his bride back to the carriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am glad the dear old lady gave us her blessing. It seemed to hallow\\r\\n\\n\\nour union, as much as the ceremony did. But I wonder how she knew I was\\r\\n\\n\\nan orphan?” said Drusilla, as they crossed the sidewalk to the carriage\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I told them as much of your circumstances as I deemed expedient to\\r\\n\\n\\naccount for your coming unattended by ladies, and in a black dress,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Alexander, as they paused while the driver got down and opened the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In a black dress! So I was married in a black dress—a black bombazine\\r\\n\\n\\nand crape dress, at that. The very deepest sort of mourning!” exclaimed\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, in a low tone and with a terrified look.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, my darling, what of that?” smiled Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, it is considered a bad omen for any one, though but a guest, to\\r\\n\\n\\nwear a black dress, even a black silk one, to a wedding. And for a bride\\r\\n\\n\\nto be married in black, especially in deep mourning, is the worst of all\\r\\n\\n\\nomens.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Omens be—blessed! Are you so superstitious, little one?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! who is not? I never met any one in my life who did not believe in\\r\\n\\n\\nthis omen.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You’ve lived so long in this world, you have! and you’ve met, so many\\r\\n\\n\\npeople!” laughed the bridegroom, as he put her into the carriage and\\r\\n\\n\\nseated himself beside her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where am I to drive to, sir, if you please?” inquired the coachman,\\r\\n\\n\\ntouching his hat, as he held the door open.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Are your horses fresh?” demanded Mr. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Quite so, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can they take us to Washington? The distance by the river-road is nine\\r\\n\\n\\nmiles, I think.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bless you, yes, sir! why they can take you to Washington, which is nine\\r\\n\\n\\nmiles, and afterwards to Bladensburg, which is nine more, with the\\r\\n\\n\\ngreatest of ease.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right—drive to Washington.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coachman closed the door, mounted to his box and started.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAn hour’s drive along the beautiful wooded road, following the south\\r\\n\\n\\nbank of the Potomac, brought the travellers to the Long Bridge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey crossed the river by that bridge and entered the city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe near view of Washington from that point is not encouraging.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander felt this as he bade his young companion look beyond the flats\\r\\n\\n\\nof the “island” and behold the distant and majestic hill upon the summit\\r\\n\\n\\nof which rises our Capitol.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe sun declined towards his setting, shone full upon the building’s\\r\\n\\n\\nwestern front, whose walls of white freestone and windows of crystal\\r\\n\\n\\nglass flashed back the rays, “in lines of dazzling light.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla uttered an exclamation of pleasure; but was interrupted by the\\r\\n\\n\\nstopping of the carriage, and the appearance of the coachman at the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor, inquiring:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where now, if you please, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To Seventh street north, and out by that road to the suburbs of the\\r\\n\\n\\ncity.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coachman re-mounted his box and started his horses once more. They\\r\\n\\n\\ncrossed the canal bridge near the centre-market, and crossed\\r\\n\\n\\nPennsylvania Avenue, and as they went on, Alexander pointed out to his\\r\\n\\n\\ncompanion, all the objects of interest within the range of their\\r\\n\\n\\nvision—a nearer view of the Capitol, then the General Post-Office, the\\r\\n\\n\\nNational Patent Office, etc.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA half hour’s drive up Seventh street north, took them beyond the limits\\r\\n\\n\\nof the city, and into the wild, picturesque and beautiful suburbs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe wilderness surroundings of our National Capitol have often been\\r\\n\\n\\nadmired by strangers who are lovers of nature, and reproached by others\\r\\n\\n\\nwho can see no beauty in anything but miles of brick walls and busy\\r\\n\\n\\nshops, or acres of ploughed fields and growing crops. We “to the manor\\r\\n\\n\\nborn,” love the wild woods and rocks and waterfalls so near, as to be\\r\\n\\n\\neven within the limits of our city. A half hour’s drive from the Capitol\\r\\n\\n\\nin any direction will take the traveller into solitudes as deep as he\\r\\n\\n\\ncan find anywhere west of the Alleghanies.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA half hour’s drive up Seventh street north took our happy pair quite\\r\\n\\n\\ninto what seemed a country road.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was bordered on the western side by evergreen woods, through which\\r\\n\\n\\nthe last rays of the setting sun were shining and tipping every\\r\\n\\n\\ndark-hued leaf and twig with golden fire; and on the north by groves and\\r\\n\\n\\nfields and streams, with here and there a solitary, but cheerful cottage\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom whose windows the “household fires gleamed warm and bright.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently, Alexander pulled the check-string and ordered the driver to\\r\\n\\n\\nturn into an obscure road or lane, leading into the cedar wood on the\\r\\n\\n\\nleft.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have never asked me where I am taking you to, my darling,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, when they had gone about a quarter of a mile into the woods.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; because my trust in you is so perfect.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Had you no curiosity?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes; but I thought you would tell me when you should see fit; and I\\r\\n\\n\\nknew that I should find out when we should reach the spot. I am very\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch pleased, however, that our home will be in the country.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not the country, darling, though it looks so much like it; only the\\r\\n\\n\\nsuburbs of the city.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is all the same to me, and I am so glad we are to live among the\\r\\n\\n\\ntrees.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I knew you would be, love, and so I chose our home in this\\r\\n\\n\\nneighborhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But shall you not be lonesome, so far from the city; you, who are so\\r\\n\\n\\nfond of plays and concerts and operas?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, mine own. I shall be lonesome nowhere, with you by my side.\\r\\n\\n\\nBesides, thirty minutes’ drive would take us any evening to any place of\\r\\n\\n\\namusement we might wish to attend in the city. But here we are at home!”\\r\\n\\n\\nhe said, pulling the check-string and stopping the carriage at a rustic\\r\\n\\n\\ngate that crossed the lane in the very midst of the wood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSome one issued from a very small porter’s lodge on the right and opened\\r\\n\\n\\nthe gate. They entered upon a semicircular drive, bordered on each side\\r\\n\\n\\nby cedar-trees, that led them up to the front of a picturesque cottage\\r\\n\\n\\nornée, built in a sort of composite style.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFrom every pretty latticed window of this little dwelling, the lights of\\r\\n\\n\\nfires and of lamps gleamed warm welcome.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what a lovely little wildwood home!” exclaimed Drusilla in delight,\\r\\n\\n\\nas Alexander lifted her from the carriage and seated her on a bench of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe little rustic porch.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Business before pleasure,’ my darling,” he said, leaving her there,\\r\\n\\n\\nand going back to dismiss the carriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was happy and therefore he was extravagant. He never asked the\\r\\n\\n\\ncoachman the price of his services, but put in his hand a twenty dollar\\r\\n\\n\\nbank note, about twice the amount of his fare; and when the latter\\r\\n\\n\\nfumbled in his pocket-book, said quickly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, I don’t want any change! It is now about five o’clock; you can\\r\\n\\n\\neasily get back to Alexandria by seven. Good night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coachman was profuse in his thanks, and hoped to have the pleasure\\r\\n\\n\\nof driving his honor often. And he mounted his box and drove off, no\\r\\n\\n\\ndoubt wishing that he could have a bridal party for a fare every day of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the bridegroom led his bride into the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                        THE CHILD BRIDE AT HOME.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n        His house she enters there to be the light,\\r\\n\\n\\n        Shining within when all without is night;\\r\\n\\n\\n        A guardian angel o’er his life presiding,\\r\\n\\n\\n        Doubling his pleasures, and his cares dividing.—ROGERS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Welcome, mine own dear love, welcome to your home,” fervently whispered\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, as he led his bride across the threshold of the door that was\\r\\n\\n\\nheld open by a pretty and neatly-dressed negro girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe young wife smiled gratefully upon her husband, and then looked\\r\\n\\n\\naround with child-like interest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey stood in a cheerful little hall, illuminated by an antique lamp in\\r\\n\\n\\na stained glass shade, that shed myriads of prismatic hues over the\\r\\n\\n\\nwhite and gilded wall and richly-carpeted floor. It was a hexagon-shaped\\r\\n\\n\\nhall, with a staircase opposite the front door, and with four other\\r\\n\\n\\ndoors, two on each side, opening into the drawing-room and dining-room\\r\\n\\n\\non the right, and the parlor and library on the left.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This is your little maid, Pina, my dear, and she will show you to your\\r\\n\\n\\nroom, if you please,” said Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla turned and smiled kindly on the bright-eyed negro girl, who\\r\\n\\n\\ntook up a wax candle, and stood curtseying and waiting orders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Go on then, Pina, and lead the way; I will follow,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Alexander placed the carpet bag that contained all the bride’s\\r\\n\\n\\ntrousseau in the hands of the girl, who, with another curtsey, turned\\r\\n\\n\\nand led the way up stairs to an upper hexagon-shaped hall, with a bay\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow in the front end, and four doors, two on each side, leading into\\r\\n\\n\\nbedrooms and dressing-rooms.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina opened the front door on the right hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what a sweet, what a pretty, what a delightful little room!”\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed Drusilla, on passing the threshold.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe room deserved her praise. It had been designed by the hands of love\\r\\n\\n\\nto please the eyes of beauty. Its colors were white and rose. The walls\\r\\n\\n\\nwere hung with a paper of a white ground, with a running vine of wild\\r\\n\\n\\nroses over it. The floor was covered with a carpet white with the same\\r\\n\\n\\npatterns of wild roses running over it. The windows were curtained with\\r\\n\\n\\nwhite lace, lined with rose-colored silk. The dressing-table that stood\\r\\n\\n\\nbetween the windows was draped to match them, in white lace over rose\\r\\n\\n\\nsilk. The bed was spread with a white crochet counterpane, lined with\\r\\n\\n\\nrose satin. The chairs and sofas were covered with white damask\\r\\n\\n\\nembroidered in roses. All the little stands and tables were in white and\\r\\n\\n\\nrose enamel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a chamber to delight a child or a young girl. To crown all, a\\r\\n\\n\\nclear, bright wood-fire was burning on the white marble hearth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is—it is a heavenly little room!” exclaimed Drusilla gazing around.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And here, ma’am, is the dressing place,” continued the maid, opening an\\r\\n\\n\\ninner door, and showing her mistress into a smaller apartment fitted up\\r\\n\\n\\nin a plainer style as a bathroom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe young traveller, who really needed ablutions after her dusty ride in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe train, opened her carpet bag, took out her dressing materials, and\\r\\n\\n\\ncommenced her toilet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina waited on her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut little change could the poor bride make. Her carpet bag could not\\r\\n\\n\\ncontain much. She had only brought a few clean linen collars, cuffs,\\r\\n\\n\\nhandkerchiefs, and other absolute essentials.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSeeing this, her handmaid said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Let me carry your dress down stairs and brush it, ma’am: it won’t take\\r\\n\\n\\nme ten minutes. I will bring it up quite nice by the time you are ready\\r\\n\\n\\nto put it on again.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla thanked the little maid, and accepted the offer. And Pina ran\\r\\n\\n\\naway with the dress. And by the time Drusilla had taken her bath and\\r\\n\\n\\ndressed her hair the girl returned with the renovated garment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Supper will be served, ma’am, as soon as you are ready for it,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nPina, laying the dress over the back of a chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla carefully but hastily completed her toilet, for she was eager\\r\\n\\n\\nto see Alexander and thank him for the care and taste he had bestowed\\r\\n\\n\\nupon the fitting up of her rooms.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs she left her chamber she found Alexander in the hexagon-shaped hall\\r\\n\\n\\noutside. He smiled, and took her arm, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“While they are placing supper on the table I wish to show you over our\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle toy palace—for it is no more.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And no less! Oh, how I thank you for the beautiful—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Doll’s house!” laughed Alexander, stopping his bride in the outpouring\\r\\n\\n\\nof her gratitude.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, but the rooms are so very beautiful!” she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, you have seen but two! Come, let me show you the others,” he said,\\r\\n\\n\\ntaking her across the little hall, and opening an opposite door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe apartment they now entered corresponded in all respects to her\\r\\n\\n\\nchamber, except that it was fitted up as a sewing-room, and its wall\\r\\n\\n\\npaper, window curtains, chair-covers, carpet and enamelled stands and\\r\\n\\n\\ntables were all in white and green instead of white and rose.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“See here, my love! I remember what a domestic little creature you were,\\r\\n\\n\\nhow you liked to sit up stairs and sew by the hour or the day, and how\\r\\n\\n\\nthe very first thing you ever wished for was a work-box, and so I had\\r\\n\\n\\nthis room fitted up for you on purpose,” said Alexander, looking in her\\r\\n\\n\\nface to read her satisfaction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, how good, how good you are to me! What can I ever do to please you\\r\\n\\n\\nenough,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Love me dearly, and be very happy! That is all I ask you to do,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nreplied. “And now look here, dear, I knew your wardrobe would want\\r\\n\\n\\ncomplete refitting, and I knew what a nice little needle-woman you were,\\r\\n\\n\\nso I have filled these bureau drawers and wardrobes with dress goods of\\r\\n\\n\\nevery description—enough to furnish forth an Indian voyage or a country\\r\\n\\n\\nshop,” he said, as he went to one of the bureaus and drew out the\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawers, one after another, to display their contents—rich silk, merino,\\r\\n\\n\\nand cashmere dress patterns, all in black, purple, or gray, or other\\r\\n\\n\\nmourning or half mourning hues; and whole pieces of fine muslin, linen,\\r\\n\\n\\nflannel, and other “staple” commodities, and rolls of ribbon, tape,\\r\\n\\n\\ngimp, and other dress trimmings.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You know I had no woman’s help in selecting these articles, and a man\\r\\n\\n\\nin a milliner’s establishment is just about us much out of place as a\\r\\n\\n\\n‘bull in a china shop,’ but I did the best I could.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“They are beautiful,” said Drusilla, in grateful delight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And see here,” continued Alexander, opening the doors of a wardrobe—and\\r\\n\\n\\ndisplaying several shawls, cloaks, circulars, mantillas and so forth—“as\\r\\n\\n\\nthese things fit almost any grown woman, I thought I could not make a\\r\\n\\n\\nmistake in getting them ready-made. What do _you_ think?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you—you are too good to me; you are extravagant—here are more than\\r\\n\\n\\nI shall wear in ten years,” said Drusilla, between smiles and tears.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not at all! There’s Anna will wear twice as many changes of apparel in\\r\\n\\n\\nten days,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, but Miss Anna is an heiress.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you are the wife of a—_wealthy_ man, if not a _good_ one,” laughed\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander. “But come, I dare say supper is waiting and spoiling. I will\\r\\n\\n\\nshow you the rest of your little house to-morrow, and also your little\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage and pair of ponies——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, _indeed_ you do too much for me.—I think I have not been used to\\r\\n\\n\\nhaving such things—of my own,” said Drusilla, meekly and confusedly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I _could not_ do too much for you, dear love——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, Mr. Alexander——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leave out the ‘Mr.’ from this time, sweet Drusa. What were you going to\\r\\n\\n\\nsay?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I was about to ask you, please, not to make me so many presents.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, is that it? Why not?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because—I love you. And—I only want you to give me your love——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know all that, my pet. But let your conscience be at rest. Every\\r\\n\\n\\nthing I seem to give you, as well as every thing you have of your own is\\r\\n\\n\\nreally not yours, but mine, because you yourself are mine.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is that so?” she smilingly inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then so I would have it!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile they talked they left the room, he leading the way down the\\r\\n\\n\\nstairs, to the little drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was a very elegant apartment, fitted up in crimson and gold\\r\\n\\n\\ncurtains, chairs and sofas, rich mirrors and rare paintings, and\\r\\n\\n\\nrecherché articles of _virtu_. At the lower end of the room a heavy\\r\\n\\n\\ncurtain of crimson satin damask, with gold bullion fringe and gold cord\\r\\n\\n\\nand tassels, hung from the ceiling to floor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile Drusilla was still gazing with curiosity and delight upon the\\r\\n\\n\\nvarious objects of interest in the room, this curtain was drawn aside as\\r\\n\\n\\nby invisible hands, revealing an elegant little dining-room, where a\\r\\n\\n\\nluxurious supper was spread.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, with a laughing assumption of ceremony, led Drusilla to the\\r\\n\\n\\nhead of the table, bowed, and took his place at the foot.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA handsome negro boy, so like Pina as to be recognizable at once for her\\r\\n\\n\\nbrother, waited at table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear, this is your other servant—footman, coachman, and groom—all in\\r\\n\\n\\none. He is named Leander; but for convenience we shall call him ‘Leo.’\\r\\n\\n\\nJust as we call his sister, who exults in the imperial name of\\r\\n\\n\\nAgrippina, simply ‘Pina,’” said Alexander, as he placed the breast of a\\r\\n\\n\\nroast pheasant on Drusilla’s plate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a pleasant supper, as you may judge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd it was followed by a happy evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                       THE WILD WOOD HOME BY DAY.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n      It is a quiet picture of delight,\\r\\n\\n\\n      The pretty cottage hiding from the sun\\r\\n\\n\\n      In the thick woods. We see it not till there,\\r\\n\\n\\n      When at its porch ... quiet’s especial temple.—W. G. SIMMS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have the vaguest idea of the outside of our home—a pretty brown\\r\\n\\n\\ncottage in evergreen woods—that was all I could make out as we\\r\\n\\n\\napproached it in the twilight last evening; and that is all I can make\\r\\n\\n\\nout now, while peering through that crimson curtained window,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, as she sat at breakfast with her husband the next morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘A pretty brown cottage, in evergreen woods.’ Well, that is all you\\r\\n\\n\\nwould make out if you were to inspect the premises most carefully every\\r\\n\\n\\nday for a month. It is a new place, my little love. The house and stable\\r\\n\\n\\nonly are finished and walled in. The grounds are not laid out or even\\r\\n\\n\\ncleared, as you may see by the thicket crowding up to the very windows,”\\r\\n\\n\\nreplied Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, I think I like it even better just so. There is something very\\r\\n\\n\\nfascinating to me in the deep, wild wood, where the trees may grow as\\r\\n\\n\\nthey please, without touch of ax or pruning knife, and where birds may\\r\\n\\n\\nsing and rabbits run without fear of trap or fowling-piece,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then if that be so, not a tree shall be felled, though we should have\\r\\n\\n\\nto send to the city market for all our fruit and vegetables,” laughed\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh no, no, no; don’t ‘Woodman, Spare That Tree’ on my account. The\\r\\n\\n\\nwoods are very charming, but so is a garden with beds of growing\\r\\n\\n\\nvegetables and parterres of blooming flowers; and so are vineyards and\\r\\n\\n\\norchards, and poultry-yards and cow-pens, none of which can be had\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout the sacrifice of the woods. And you know what a good little\\r\\n\\n\\nfarmer your dear mother——” Here the tears rushed to the bride’s eyes,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut she quickly wiped them away and smiled, saying: “No, I will not weep\\r\\n\\n\\nthe day after our wedding. I will remember that she is in Heaven,\\r\\n\\n\\nand—happy as we may be, she is happier still.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But what were you about to say, love, when you broke off?” gravely and\\r\\n\\n\\ngently inquired Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I was going to remind you what a skillful little farmer your dear\\r\\n\\n\\nmother had made of me, and to tell you how well I can manage a little\\r\\n\\n\\nplace like this, with the help of the two servants.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, darling; but you will not need to do so. What? You worry with the\\r\\n\\n\\ncultivation of cabbage and onions, and the rearing of fowls and turkeys,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the feeding of cows and pigs? It is ridiculous, the idea!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But your dear mother saw to all such things with her own eyes, and\\r\\n\\n\\noften helped among them with her own hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My venerated mother belonged to an old school of housekeepers that are\\r\\n\\n\\nnow obsolete, or fast passing away before the progress of civilization.\\r\\n\\n\\nMachinery does the work of laborers, and laborers have become\\r\\n\\n\\nintelligent directors of machinery. Nonsense! Even if this were not so,\\r\\n\\n\\ndo you think I would let you spoil your exquisite beauty in the way you\\r\\n\\n\\npropose, Drusa? No, my darling, your beauty is too rare and rich to be\\r\\n\\n\\nput to any such uses. I think that even if I were a very poor man, I\\r\\n\\n\\nwould rather labor day and night than you should soil your pretty\\r\\n\\n\\nhands,” he whispered, lifting one of the little members of which he\\r\\n\\n\\nspoke, and gazing on it with the eyes of a connoisseur and the smile of\\r\\n\\n\\na lover.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alexander! dear Alexander!” said the little bride, earnestly,\\r\\n\\n\\n“please do not prize my looks so much. It frightens me when you do so.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But why?” smiled the bridegroom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, because—one’s looks——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“One’s beauty, you mean——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alexander, it is such an accidental and perishable thing to be\\r\\n\\n\\nloved for. Illness or chance might destroy it in a day; and time will\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainly impair it in the course of years. And whether I lose it sooner\\r\\n\\n\\nor later, what shall I do if I lose your love also?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was spoken so gravely and feelingly that the bridegroom burst into\\r\\n\\n\\na laugh.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why you solemn little quiz! You remind me of a little prig of a Sunday\\r\\n\\n\\nschool scholar that I used to see perched up in the corner of the\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper’s room in my mother’s house in Richmond. A little ‘rum un’\\r\\n\\n\\nwho used to sew quilt pieces and lecture lost sheep.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But oh, tell me one thing. Even if I should grow ugly, you would love\\r\\n\\n\\nme still, would you not, Alexander?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_You_ grow ugly? impossible! Your beauty, if you take common care of\\r\\n\\n\\nit, will last you until you are sixty years old, and by that time, I,\\r\\n\\n\\nwho am so much your senior, will be so blind with age, or love, or\\r\\n\\n\\nhabit, that I shall not know whether you are a Venus or a Gorgon,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, laughing, and rising from the table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Till I am sixty! So many years to live together, you and I, if Heaven\\r\\n\\n\\nshould spare us. Such a long and happy life, if you only love me all the\\r\\n\\n\\ntime. Oh, what can I do to keep you loving me all these long, long\\r\\n\\n\\nyears?” aspirated Drusilla, in a sort of repressed fervor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Be beautiful, be happy and love me—that is all,” he answered. “And now\\r\\n\\n\\nput on some outer garment and come with me, and I will show you what\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle is to be seen of our small place.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla took a gray hooded cloak from the hands of the maid who had run\\r\\n\\n\\nand fetched it for her, and she wrapped herself in it, drew the hood\\r\\n\\n\\nover her head, and took the offered arm of Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe led her out of the front door and down the step of the porch to the\\r\\n\\n\\nbroad carriage drive that had been cleared through the cedars from the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse to the gate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a fine wintry day. A little snow had fallen during the night,\\r\\n\\n\\njust sufficient to cover the ground with a white garment and powder the\\r\\n\\n\\ncedars like coachmen’s wigs; but the sky was now clear and the sun\\r\\n\\n\\nbright.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey walked down the drive to the gate, and then, at Alexander’s\\r\\n\\n\\nsuggestion, turned about and leaned against the gate, and faced the\\r\\n\\n\\nfront of the cottage to take a look at it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A mere toy palace, or doll’s house, as I told you,” said Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\ndisparagingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is a beauty. But perhaps you are comparing it with spacious Crowood\\r\\n\\n\\nor lofty Lyon Hall; in which case it must suffer by comparison in size,\\r\\n\\n\\nI grant you, but not in beauty,” said Drusilla, gazing on her home with\\r\\n\\n\\nperfect satisfaction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very glad you approve of it, darling, even in its half finished\\r\\n\\n\\ncondition. In another year I will see what money and taste can do to\\r\\n\\n\\nconvert it into a paradise for you,” said Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The sweet spot is Arcadia already. But how were you so fortunate as to\\r\\n\\n\\nget it, dear Alexander? And have you rented it, or bought it?” she\\r\\n\\n\\nasked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have taken it on trial for a year, with the privilege of purchasing\\r\\n\\n\\nit, if I like it, at the end of that time.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But why does the owner wish to sell such a pretty place, which he has\\r\\n\\n\\nonly just built?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, love, it is a common case. The place was commenced by a poor old\\r\\n\\n\\nfellow, who was about to retire from business on a comfortable\\r\\n\\n\\ncompetency. But he put off living too long, for just as he was preparing\\r\\n\\n\\nto do it he died.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor man! and he never enjoyed the pretty place.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Let us hope that he enjoys a better one. Meanwhile we have the\\r\\n\\n\\nprivilege of purchasing it, if we like.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I do like it so much!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then consider it purchased, my pet.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not on my account. Oh, Alexander, dear, please do always what you judge\\r\\n\\n\\nto be best without thinking of me in the matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, darling, if I love you as you wish me to do, and as I certainly\\r\\n\\n\\ndo, I _must_ think of your pleasure in everything.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked at him, secretly acknowledging the truth of his words, yet\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch perplexed by them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe house upon which they gazed, incomplete as were its surroundings,\\r\\n\\n\\ndeserved all Drusilla’s praise.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a charming little cottage ornée, which, if the truth may be\\r\\n\\n\\nspoken, was much more suitable as the home of a fresh young bride than\\r\\n\\n\\nthe resting-place of a worn-out old worldling. It was built after no\\r\\n\\n\\nparticular plan, and therefore perhaps all the more picturesque and\\r\\n\\n\\npleasing in its aspect. It was so irregularly and fantastically erected\\r\\n\\n\\nas to defy all manner of description. From the outside it seemed an\\r\\n\\n\\neccentric collection of low walls and steep roofs, gable ends, twisted\\r\\n\\n\\nchimneys, hanging balconies, bay-windows, porches, verandahs, and so\\r\\n\\n\\nforth. Its dark gray stone walls and dark green Venetian shutters and\\r\\n\\n\\npillars and cornices, so harmonized in hue with the colors of the wintry\\r\\n\\n\\nwoods, as at a short distance to mingle with them and be\\r\\n\\n\\nindistinguishable from them. Such was the outside of Drusilla’s little\\r\\n\\n\\nhome.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe inside was a collection of hexagon shaped halls, chambers, parlors,\\r\\n\\n\\nquaint closets, cosy recesses and sunny nooks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now I will take you round and show you the stable and the cow-house,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Alexander, drawing his wife’s arm within his own, and leading her\\r\\n\\n\\naround to the rear of the house where, in a neat and well kept stable,\\r\\n\\n\\nhe showed her a pretty pair of gray ponies and a neat little carriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked up in his face to thank him with her eyes, but when she would\\r\\n\\n\\nhave spoken, he stopped her with a kiss.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he took her to an adjoining compartment of the same building, and\\r\\n\\n\\nshowed her a white cow with a young calf beside her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I can not thank you enough; no, I can not—not only for all that you\\r\\n\\n\\nhave given me, but for the _beauty_ of every object and every living\\r\\n\\n\\ncreature you have placed around me—the beautiful house and furniture,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe beautiful carriage and ponies, the pretty white cow and calf. Dear\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, I thank you so much for all the beauty with which you have\\r\\n\\n\\nblessed my home,” smiled and faltered Drusilla, in a voice broken by\\r\\n\\n\\nhappy emotions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beauty! why who was it that, just now, begged and prayed me not to love\\r\\n\\n\\nher for her beauty?” asked Alexander, quizzingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It was I, of course,” said Drusilla, blushing and laughing, “but that\\r\\n\\n\\nwas because I wished you to love me for something deeper and more\\r\\n\\n\\nlasting.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And so I do, darling; but come—confess that you like beautiful\\r\\n\\n\\nthings—that you like even _me_ better for not being ill-looking.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alexander, not you! it was never your looks, although I like you to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe handsome. But oh, dear Alick, if you were to be maimed by accident or\\r\\n\\n\\nmarked by illness, I should love you quite as much as I do now, and even\\r\\n\\n\\nmore tenderly, I think, as I know I shall love you when you are old and\\r\\n\\n\\ngray.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bah! I would rather die than grow old and gray; but the time for that\\r\\n\\n\\nis far enough off, thank Heaven!” said Alexander, as he led her back\\r\\n\\n\\ninto the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe took her into the drawing-room and showed her three musical\\r\\n\\n\\ninstruments, each of the very best quality—a piano, a harp and a guitar.\\r\\n\\n\\nUpon a stand near was a collection of old standard music, and of all the\\r\\n\\n\\nbest new pieces out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nI suppose no one but a monomaniac in music can understand the delight of\\r\\n\\n\\nsitting down and trying the tone of a new instrument of the very best\\r\\n\\n\\norder.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla placed herself at the piano, and ran her fingers up and down\\r\\n\\n\\nthe keys to test its powers. And then she turned over her music and sang\\r\\n\\n\\nsong after song, for hour after hour, without weariness. And Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nleaned over her, and listened to her without flagging.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen at length she arose from the piano, he led her from the\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing-room and across the hexagon hall to an opposite room, fitted up\\r\\n\\n\\nas a library. Here, in the elegant book cases, were collected some of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe best standard works in English, French and German, also some choice\\r\\n\\n\\nLatin and Greek volumes, and a few of the most popular publications of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe day.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere were neat writing desks, easy reading chairs, soft foot cushions,\\r\\n\\n\\nand every means and appliance of comfort and luxury.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd on the walls were a few very choice pictures, and on stands stood\\r\\n\\n\\nstatuettes and vases and other gems of art, to please a cultivated\\r\\n\\n\\ntaste.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No words—you leave me no words to thank you for all these blessings,”\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla murmured.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I tell you they are all mine as you are mine, so there are no words\\r\\n\\n\\nwanted for thanks,” smiled Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! but I know you did all this for me; I feel it and I must say it,\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick, dear Alick,” she murmured, with tears of love and joy in her\\r\\n\\n\\neyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAll the time they were in the library they heard the songs of birds—a\\r\\n\\n\\nsound so unusual in that wintry season, that Drusilla had looked up once\\r\\n\\n\\nor twice with a startled expression; but as Alexander had only smiled at\\r\\n\\n\\nher surprise without attempting to gratify her unspoken curiosity, she\\r\\n\\n\\nforbore to ask him questions, and waited until he should explain the\\r\\n\\n\\nmystery.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come now,” he said, “I have something else to show you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he led her down to the lower end of the room, to a green curtain\\r\\n\\n\\nthat hung from ceiling to floor, and from side to side, and\\r\\n\\n\\ncorresponded, except in color, with that one which divided the\\r\\n\\n\\ndining-room from the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe drew aside this curtain and revealed a scene of enchantment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a room of crystal glass, in gilded sashes, and it was filled with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe rarest and most beautiful exotic plants, most of them in full bloom.\\r\\n\\n\\nAmong these plants hung large gilded cages, in which were birds of the\\r\\n\\n\\nmost brilliant plumage and the sweetest notes, whose songs filled all\\r\\n\\n\\nthe sunny and perfumed air with melody.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBirds and flowers of all the objects in nature had always been\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla’s especial delight. Her love of them might have been called a\\r\\n\\n\\npassion. And it had never been gratified until now. And here she had\\r\\n\\n\\nthem of the most beautiful sorts, gathered in one splendid crystal room\\r\\n\\n\\nlike a fairy palace. And as she looked a smile of rapture lighted up her\\r\\n\\n\\nlovely face, and then she turned towards the giver of all these and\\r\\n\\n\\ntried to utter her feelings; but instead of speaking, she burst into\\r\\n\\n\\ntears, threw herself in his arms, and sobbed on his bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe had overwhelmed her with his gifts, as he had done once before.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHow smilingly he caressed and soothed her, until she lifted up her head,\\r\\n\\n\\ndashed away her tears, and said, laughing:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘I am a fool to weep at what I am glad of,’ as Juliet, or Lady Macbeth,\\r\\n\\n\\nor Regan, or Goneril, or some one of Shakespeare’s women says.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Miranda, my love; it was Miranda. Never misquote Shakespeare; never\\r\\n\\n\\neven in your most confidential communications to your most intimate\\r\\n\\n\\nfriends; never even in soliloquy and in solitude!” said Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\nshaking his head in mock gravity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed I wasn’t even sure it _was_ in Shakespeare,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now to the dining-room. I think we have earned an appetite for\\r\\n\\n\\ndinner,” smiled Alexander, drawing her arm within his own, and leading\\r\\n\\n\\nher from the library.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis evening was spent in the drawing-room, where tea was served.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so ended the second day of their bright honeymoon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                            CLOUDLESS JOYS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                   Oh, pleasant was her welcome kiss,\\r\\n\\n\\n                     When day’s turmoil was o’er,\\r\\n\\n\\n                   And sweet the music of her step,\\r\\n\\n\\n                     That met him at the door.—DRAKE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor the first few days of their honeymoon, the bridegroom stayed home\\r\\n\\n\\nwith his bride—walking, riding, or playing with her in the mornings, and\\r\\n\\n\\nreading, singing, or conversing with her in the evenings.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Sunday, she asked him to take her to church, and he took her to the\\r\\n\\n\\nnearest one of the sect to which she belonged.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Monday, he took her into the city, to show her the public buildings\\r\\n\\n\\nand other objects of interest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, they remained quietly at home. The\\r\\n\\n\\nweather was very inclement. It had been raining three days, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nroads were very bad.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander spent the time in doors, in writing letters, examining\\r\\n\\n\\naccounts, and reading to Drusilla, while she worked with her needle. But\\r\\n\\n\\nthe gay young man of the world found this life “slow.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn the third dull afternoon that the poor little bride had tried her\\r\\n\\n\\nbest to enliven, while he sat reading to her as she sewed, he suddenly\\r\\n\\n\\nthrew the book from him, got up, yawned, walked up and down the room a\\r\\n\\n\\nfew turns, looked out of the window at the drizzling rain and gloomy\\r\\n\\n\\nsky, and then turning to his companion, said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusa, the weather is infernal, but—the German Opera is in Washington,\\r\\n\\n\\nand our carriage is close. So what do you say to braving the rain and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe wind to see _Der Freichutz_ by the best troupe of artists that has\\r\\n\\n\\never appeared in the city.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked up quickly, and saw that he was anxious to go. She replied:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall be delighted, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are not afraid of taking cold?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not a bit! I would go through Noah’s Flood to hear good music.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That’s my girl! You’re a brick. I’m so glad you are not one of the\\r\\n\\n\\ntimid or sickly sort. That little pale face of yours is very deceptive,\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusa. One would think to look at you that you were very delicate, but I\\r\\n\\n\\nnever saw or heard of your being sick my life.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Except when I cried myself into a fit of illness, when you went to\\r\\n\\n\\nEurope, Alick. Oh, I hope I shall never have another such a trouble as\\r\\n\\n\\nthat, as long as I live in this world. I remember it yet. Alick, dear, I\\r\\n\\n\\nwould rather die than lose you for another two years,” she said with\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch feeling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Little goose! I’m not worth a tenth, a hundredth, no, not a thousandth\\r\\n\\n\\npart of the love you bestow on me,” he answered laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, I would not permit any one but yourself to say such things\\r\\n\\n\\nof you. And I—I won’t let you say them either, sir; so there, now.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, run away and get ready. I will order the carriage.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla tripped up stairs to make her toilet. And Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nsauntered out of the room to give directions to his factotum.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn less than half an hour Drusilla came down, dressed for the evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe carriage was at the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have no tickets, of course; and consequently no reserved seats. But,\\r\\n\\n\\non such an inclement night as this, I do not doubt that we shall be able\\r\\n\\n\\nto obtain good places,” said Alexander, as he handed her into the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe roads were heavy, and so, a drive, that in good weather could have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen easily accomplished in thirty minutes, occupied them for\\r\\n\\n\\nforty-five.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was rather late when they reached the National Theatre, where the\\r\\n\\n\\nopera troupe were performing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe house was full, and the play had commenced.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUpon inquiry at the ticket-office, Alexander ascertained that there were\\r\\n\\n\\nno good seats to be had, with the exception of those in a stage box,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat happened to be disengaged.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander at once took that, and guided by an usher, led his companion\\r\\n\\n\\nthither.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn taking her seat in the box, Drusilla’s eyes fell upon what seemed to\\r\\n\\n\\nher a scene of enchantment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe house was filled with a fashionable and well-dressed audience, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe opera was in full play. Drusilla had never been in an opera before.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Christmas pantomimes of her childhood comprised the whole of her\\r\\n\\n\\nexperiences in the theatrical line. Her artistic eye and ear at once\\r\\n\\n\\nappealed to, she gazed with curiosity and interest, and listened with\\r\\n\\n\\nwonder and delight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer attention was fixed upon the stage, but her bridegroom’s was fixed\\r\\n\\n\\nupon her. As once before, in her childhood, he had looked through her\\r\\n\\n\\neyes, and heard through her ears, and derived more pleasure from _her_\\r\\n\\n\\npleasure, than from the performance on the stage, so now he experienced\\r\\n\\n\\na keener delight in watching and wondering at\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n             “The mind, the music breathing from her face,”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nthan in listening to the most divine strains of the singer, who was\\r\\n\\n\\ncharming the whole house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHow beautiful she looked in her enthusiasm! She was lovely always, even\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen pale and still, but now her lips and cheeks glowed with that\\r\\n\\n\\ndelicate, transparent fire, kindled of emotion, and her eyes beamed with\\r\\n\\n\\nlight, her whole countenance was radiant and inspired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was so much absorbed in contemplating her, that he did not perceive\\r\\n\\n\\nshe had attracted and was receiving a great deal of attention from other\\r\\n\\n\\nquarters of the house. Next to the figures on the stage, the occupants\\r\\n\\n\\nof the “private” boxes have the most conspicuous position; and if there\\r\\n\\n\\nis a new beauty among them, she is sure to be discovered and stared at.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander had not thought of this, or perhaps he would not have\\r\\n\\n\\nexhibited his little beauty in a private box.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the second act of the opera, however, he was unpleasantly\\r\\n\\n\\nreminded of the fact. The box door opened, and one of his gentleman\\r\\n\\n\\nacquaintances came in.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander arose and shook hands with him, but did not ask him to be\\r\\n\\n\\nseated, although there were two spare chairs; and did not present him to\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, although the visitor looked enquiringly at her, and Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nglanced timidly in return.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore this gentleman left the box, another came, and then another,\\r\\n\\n\\nuntil the little place was full. And Alexander chatted gaily with them\\r\\n\\n\\nall, but presented not one of them to Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the curtain arose for the third act, they all bowed and withdrew.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla’s whole attention was once more given to the stage, and\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander’s to her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYet, now that his notice had been attracted to the fact, he could not\\r\\n\\n\\nhelp seeing that several opera glasses were still levelled at his box.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will never bring her here again,” he muttered to himself, frowning\\r\\n\\n\\nwith a strangely blended feeling of gratified pride in the admiration\\r\\n\\n\\nhis beautiful bride had unconsciously excited, and of morose jealousy\\r\\n\\n\\nthat other eyes should gaze on her so publicly at will. There was\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething of the sultan in Mr. Lyon’s selfish nature, and he felt as if\\r\\n\\n\\nhe would have liked to shut up his little beauty from all the world\\r\\n\\n\\nforever.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was heartily glad when the play was over. And while the performers\\r\\n\\n\\nwere still curtseying\\t and bowing, and the curtain was slowly rolling\\r\\n\\n\\ndown, he hurried Drusilla up from her seat, wrapped her cloak around\\r\\n\\n\\nher, and took her off lest some of his unwelcome visitors should meet\\r\\n\\n\\nthem on their way out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen they were seated in their carriage, and the horses were moving at a\\r\\n\\n\\nsmart trot down Pennsylvania avenue towards Seventh street, Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nturned to his now quiet companion, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You were very much pleased, my little love?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, more than that; I have been in Heaven!” she aspirated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You little enthusiast! But what makes you so quiet now?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have scarcely got back to earth, I suppose.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusa, you saw those visitors that came into our box?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; they were friends of yours, and looked as if they expected you to\\r\\n\\n\\nintroduce them to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I dare say they did; but, Drusilla, did you wish me to do so?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I? I had no wish on the subject. But any friends of yours, Alick, would\\r\\n\\n\\nbe always most welcome to my acquaintance.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not so, little one. A man may have many friends that he would not like\\r\\n\\n\\nto present to his wife. And these—were roughs.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Roughs?’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Rude, unbroken colts, unfit for a gentlewoman’s society. But let them\\r\\n\\n\\npass. I only wished to explain why I did not introduce them to you. Now\\r\\n\\n\\nas to the entertainment of the evening. How did you like Xitz?” he\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired, mentioning the tenor of the troupe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla went off into raptures over the tenor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd they talked of the opera and of nothing else until they reached\\r\\n\\n\\nhome.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLights from the windows were gleaming through the trees as they drove up\\r\\n\\n\\nto the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How bright and cheerful our little home looks,” said Drusilla, as\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander lifted her from the carriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am glad you think so, love,” he whispered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina opened the door, and smilingly admitted them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe took her mistress’s hood and cloak, while her master relieved\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself of his cap and overcoat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then she opened the drawing-room door where a fine fire was burning.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd while they stood and warmed themselves before its blaze she drew\\r\\n\\n\\naside the crimson curtain that shut off the dining-room, and revealed an\\r\\n\\n\\nelegant little supper set out in readiness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the evening closed as pleasantly as it had commenced.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander loved Drusilla; there is no doubt of that. But as the days\\r\\n\\n\\nwore on he found life alone with her rather dull. They had been married\\r\\n\\n\\na fortnight before he left her alone for a day. But on a certain morning\\r\\n\\n\\nhe had his horse saddled to ride in to Washington “to get the papers,”\\r\\n\\n\\nhe said, and to make arrangements for having them sent to him every day.\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he kissed Drusilla good-bye he added that he should be back as soon\\r\\n\\n\\nas possible.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe begged that he would not hurry himself for her sake. She said she\\r\\n\\n\\nwould occupy her time with dress-making during his absence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But you will be quite alone my poor little love,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall have pleasant thoughts for company,” she answered; and she\\r\\n\\n\\nadded: “Dear Alick, I do not wish to be a hamper to your motions; never\\r\\n\\n\\nthink of me as any obstacle to your freedom. Please don’t.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As if I ever thought of anything else but you!” replied the bridegroom,\\r\\n\\n\\nwho was still a lover. And he kissed her again and rode away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs soon as Alick reached the city he put his horse up at a livery\\r\\n\\n\\nstable, and gave himself a holiday by sauntering up and down\\r\\n\\n\\nPennsylvania avenue, and lounging into the various reading rooms of the\\r\\n\\n\\nhotels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn one of them he heard that an exciting polemic duel was to come off\\r\\n\\n\\nthat day in the Senate Chamber between two distinguished Senators of\\r\\n\\n\\nopposite parties in politics. Mr. W. of Massachusetts was expected to\\r\\n\\n\\nmake a speech, which Mr. C. of South Carolina was expected to answer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Alexander determined to go with the crowd and hear them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe lost no time in hurrying to the Capitol, and making his way to the\\r\\n\\n\\ngallery of the Senate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was the very height of the Washington season, and the city was as\\r\\n\\n\\nusual every winter, filled to overflowing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs many of the elite as could be pressed into that very limited space\\r\\n\\n\\nwas crowded into the gallery of the Senate Chamber.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander with much difficulty made his way into this crowd. But Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon was epicurean rather than intellectual, and would not endure\\r\\n\\n\\npersonal discomfort for the sake of hearing the grandest burst of\\r\\n\\n\\neloquence that ever thunderstruck the world. So after experiencing\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething of heat, pressure, and suffocation he turned his back upon the\\r\\n\\n\\n“Godlike,” and pushed his way through the crowd in the gallery to the\\r\\n\\n\\ncrowd outside who were trying to get in, and so slowly progressed to the\\r\\n\\n\\nlibrary, were the “population” was thinner and the air purer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe walked up to a table where several ladies and gentlemen were gathered\\r\\n\\n\\nto look at some new illustrated volumes that lay there for inspection.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOne of the ladies turned around, and he found himself face to face with\\r\\n\\n\\nhis Cousin Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Good gracious, Alick_, who on earth would have expected to see you\\r\\n\\n\\nhere!” she exclaimed in astonishment, as she offered her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe turned red and pale; took and pressed the offered hand, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nrecovered himself and answered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Or _you_, Anna. I thought you were still at Old Lyon Hall.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I thought you were at Richmond, or rather I had hoped you were by\\r\\n\\n\\nthis time.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My uncle is here with you, of course,” said Alexander, wishing to avoid\\r\\n\\n\\na topic which he saw upon the lips of his cousin.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, certainly, my grandfather is here. Our coming was his act. He\\r\\n\\n\\nfancied—it was only fancy—that my health and spirits were drooping in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe country, and that I needed a change, and so he brought me to\\r\\n\\n\\nWashington. Of course being in mourning, we do not go to balls, only to\\r\\n\\n\\nreceptions where there is no dancing. But how is it that you are here?\\r\\n\\n\\nWhy are you not in Richmond?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope my uncle is quite well?” said Alexander, persistently ignoring\\r\\n\\n\\nher questions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, quite. I was asking you why——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do not see him; he is not with you this morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; he is on the floor of the Senate Chamber. But, Alexander, I asked\\r\\n\\n\\nyou why you are here.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I too, needed a change,” he answered, smiling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! but surely, Alexander, can you know——By the way, what have you been\\r\\n\\n\\ndoing with yourself for the last month in which we have not heard from\\r\\n\\n\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Here is a catechism! Wandering about to be sure; trying to shake off a\\r\\n\\n\\nvery disagreeable companion—meaning myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile he spoke she was regarding him with a very grave face; but there\\r\\n\\n\\nwas more of pity than rebuke in its expression.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick, you _cannot_ know. When did you hear from your home?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not for four or five weeks.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then you _don’t_ know. Oh, Alick, do you think it was right to leave\\r\\n\\n\\nyour home without giving your address, in case anything should happen to\\r\\n\\n\\nrequire your presence. Oh, Alick!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anna, since the death of my dear father and mother, in addition to the\\r\\n\\n\\ngrief for their loss I have been oppressed with the cares of the estate.\\r\\n\\n\\nI wished to get rid of trouble for a little while. And so, to prevent\\r\\n\\n\\nold Dorset from writing to me about business, I came away without\\r\\n\\n\\nleaving my address.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And suppose, Alick, something of importance should have required your\\r\\n\\n\\nattention in the meantime? Some matter of life or death?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, thank Heaven, no such matter has turned up. I see you before me\\r\\n\\n\\nin health and beauty. And I hear you say that my uncle is quite well.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And yet something has happened. Come with me, Alick, to the window\\r\\n\\n\\nyonder,” said Anna, in a low voice, as she walked off to a distant part\\r\\n\\n\\nof the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Have you really heard nothing from Dorset, Alick?” she inquired, when\\r\\n\\n\\nthey stood together at some distance from every one else in the library.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; I hope nothing has happened to the poor old fellow?” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, uneasily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, not to him, or to any of the servants. Oh, Alick, I am so sorry\\r\\n\\n\\nto be the first to tell you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Of what in the name of Heaven, Anna, since you and your grandfather,\\r\\n\\n\\nand even old Dorset and the servants are well.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Was there no one else in whom you took an interest?” she gravely\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Richard Hammond? Poor Dick! Surely no misfortune——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, no misfortune has befallen Dick; and neither do I give you credit\\r\\n\\n\\nfor caring a straw whether there has or has not. Nothing has happened to\\r\\n\\n\\nDick but the inheritance of a large fortune from a bachelor uncle in\\r\\n\\n\\nBrazil, which has caused my grandfather to look on him with more\\r\\n\\n\\ntolerant eyes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very glad of Dick’s good fortune.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do not give you credit for caring a fig for his fortune, good or bad.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut oh, Alick, I am grieved for you. Was there no one else, no one else\\r\\n\\n\\nyou cared for, left at home?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, I cannot think of any other creature in whom I could be\\r\\n\\n\\nexpected to take so deep an interest.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not—poor little Drusilla?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander gave a great guilty start and stood gazing at his cousin.\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla had not been associated in his mind with any one left at home;\\r\\n\\n\\nso he had had no suspicion that Anna spoke of her; and now he wondered\\r\\n\\n\\nwhether Anna had any inkling of the truth. He doubted only an instant,\\r\\n\\n\\nand then he felt sure by her words, looks and manners that she had not.\\r\\n\\n\\nYet he wished to know everything she had to say of Drusilla’s flight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What of her?” he inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, poor little thing! I grieve so much to tell you. But after\\r\\n\\n\\nyou left home, it seems she became moody, silent, absent, and altogether\\r\\n\\n\\nqueer. She took to wandering off every day by herself. Dorset and Molly\\r\\n\\n\\nthought that she was going deranged as her poor mother had gone. So they\\r\\n\\n\\nwatched her closely. But one day, about a fortnight after you left home,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe eluded their vigilance and disappeared from the house. And though\\r\\n\\n\\nthe most diligent search was made for her, she could not be found.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna paused, and Alexander tried to look as much shocked as she\\r\\n\\n\\nevidently expected him to be; but he could not yet trust himself to make\\r\\n\\n\\nany comment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Old Dorset, nearly beside himself with distress, wrote to my\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandfather, telling him of what had occurred, and asking for your\\r\\n\\n\\naddress that he might communicate the matter to you. Of course, not\\r\\n\\n\\nknowing it, my grandfather could not give it. But I did hope the old man\\r\\n\\n\\nhad discovered your whereabouts and written to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, he has not. Dear me! Poor girl, poor girl! how shocking! And no\\r\\n\\n\\ntrace has been discovered of her yet?” said Alexander, acting grief and\\r\\n\\n\\nanxiety as well as any ordinary stage-player could.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“None that I knew of.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bless my life, how dreadful! I must put advertisements in all the\\r\\n\\n\\npapers and employ the detectives. What motive does old Dorset assign to\\r\\n\\n\\nher act of leaving her home?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Partial derangement, I tell you, inherited from her mother.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor child! poor child! I will have inquiries set on foot immediately.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut—here comes General Lyon,” said Alexander, glad to have a diversion\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom the very embarrassing subject of Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn fact, at that moment the old soldier entered the library, looking to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe right and left in search of his grand-daughter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAttended by Alexander, she went to meet him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, my dear, ready to go back to our hotel?—Ah, Alexander, how do you\\r\\n\\n\\ndo, my boy? Glad to see you. How long have you been here?” he asked,\\r\\n\\n\\ncordially shaking hands with his nephew.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I reached the city early this morning,” said Alexander, speaking the\\r\\n\\n\\n_literal_ truth, but giving a false impression, as he meant to do.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! by the first train, eh?” exclaimed the old man, jumping to the\\r\\n\\n\\nobvious conclusion. “But where do you hang out, eh, my boy?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have not taken rooms yet,” replied Alexander, who found that he\\r\\n\\n\\nneeded all his presence of mind to answer these unexpected questions\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout betraying himself on the one hand and perjuring himself on the\\r\\n\\n\\nother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! left all your luggage at the station, eh? Well, I would advise you\\r\\n\\n\\nto take rooms at our hotel. We are pretty comfortable there?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How long do you propose to stay here, sir?” inquired the young man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, the rest of the season, I suppose.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere was a dilemma. Of course, Alexander might have ended all his\\r\\n\\n\\nembarrassments by candidly confessing his marriage with Drusilla. And\\r\\n\\n\\nwhy did he not do so? Simply because loving and admiring his young\\r\\n\\n\\nbride, as he certainly did, he was nevertheless ashamed of having wedded\\r\\n\\n\\nhis housekeeper’s daughter; and he lacked moral courage to face the\\r\\n\\n\\nastonishment of his cousin and the indignation of his uncle, and to\\r\\n\\n\\ndefend his own act and stand by his own wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh! but there is a sort of pride that is below contempt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile Alexander was wondering what he should do to get out of his\\r\\n\\n\\nperplexities, his uncle changed the subject back to the other dangerous\\r\\n\\n\\ntheme by saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, by the way, that was a sad thing—the fate of poor little Drusilla.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very sad, indeed, sir,” replied Alexander, lugubriously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It must have shocked you terribly,” said the old soldier.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” exclaimed Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, well, it can’t be helped, I suppose.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall do all I can in the premises, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no doubt, no doubt. Come, my dear Anna, let us get on. Alick, come\\r\\n\\n\\nhome with us to dinner.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander would have made excuses. He was not dressed for dinner, he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid. He had no means of making his toilet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut his uncle cut him short.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense, man, nonsense. Who expects you to be in full dress to-day?\\r\\n\\n\\nYou are a traveller, just arrived in the city. You have left your\\r\\n\\n\\nluggage at the station, and you have not even engaged rooms yet.\\r\\n\\n\\nBesides—at a hotel table, who cares how you are dressed? Come along.\\r\\n\\n\\nThere! give Anna your arm, and take her to the carriage.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat could Alick do?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe offered his arm to his cousin and led her down the many broad steps\\r\\n\\n\\nleading to the east front of the capitol, where the carriage waited. He\\r\\n\\n\\nhanded her carefully in to her cushioned seat, and bowed and attempted\\r\\n\\n\\nsome excuse for leaving her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Anna, seized with some inexplicable whim, perhaps inspired by the\\r\\n\\n\\nSpirit of Evil for his torment, would not let him off; but insisted upon\\r\\n\\n\\nhis entering and taking a seat beside her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith a suppressed groan, Alexander obeyed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old soldier followed them into the carriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen he was comfortably seated and the horses had started, he rubbed his\\r\\n\\n\\nhands and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This is fortunate. I needed some one whom I could trust, to take Anna\\r\\n\\n\\nout in the evening. Who so proper an escort as her betrothed husband?\\r\\n\\n\\nNow this evening there is to be a grand reception at the Executive\\r\\n\\n\\nMansion. I do not feel well enough to go out at night, so I must impress\\r\\n\\n\\nyou into the service, my boy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I should be most happy, sir,” said the young man, actually trembling\\r\\n\\n\\nunder his accumulating embarrassment. “I should indeed be delighted,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But what?—Oh, nonsense, you cannot make any excuse about your toilet in\\r\\n\\n\\nthis case; there is plenty of time to get your luggage from the station,\\r\\n\\n\\nand get yourself up for the evening in the most unexceptionable style.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir, but——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But what, again? You cannot possibly have any other engagement. You\\r\\n\\n\\nhave been in the city too short a time. Alexander, what has come to you?\\r\\n\\n\\nYou are not like yourself at all. I really think your betrothed has a\\r\\n\\n\\nreason to feel piqued,” said the old man, gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I beg your pardon and hers, sir—I am—if I must speak the truth, a\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle upset upon the subject of that poor girl,” said Alexander, in\\r\\n\\n\\nexplanation, again speaking the literal truth, while intentionally\\r\\n\\n\\ngiving a wrong impression.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh exactly, to be sure, my dear boy, and it does you credit. I am\\r\\n\\n\\ncertain I ought to beg _your_ pardon, now, for doing injustice to your\\r\\n\\n\\ngood feelings. But Alick, my lad, your compassion for that poor child\\r\\n\\n\\nneed not prevent you from ordinary social pleasures. You really must\\r\\n\\n\\nescort your cousin to the President’s reception to-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear grandfather,” put in Anna, “I will not, if you please, have any\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman pressed into my service against his will, even though that\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman should be my affianced husband. Dick is in Washington. He\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled on me this morning, and begged leave to attend me to the White\\r\\n\\n\\nHouse this evening. I told him I would hold his proposal in reserve, and\\r\\n\\n\\nlet him know in time.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNow what was there in the name of his old rival, poor Dick, that should\\r\\n\\n\\nhave raised Alexander’s jealousy? Mr. Lyon was a married man, and had no\\r\\n\\n\\nright to feel annoyed at the idea of Richard Hammond becoming the escort\\r\\n\\n\\nof his cousin. Nevertheless he _did_ feel annoyed, partly, perhaps,\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause he had once considered Anna his own property, and however\\r\\n\\n\\nlightly he had valued the possession, he could not, even now, see her\\r\\n\\n\\npass over to another without a secret feeling of rage and jealousy; and\\r\\n\\n\\nso he hesitated to answer:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, my dear cousin; if you please, I claim the right of attending you\\r\\n\\n\\nin person. I can not resign that right to Mr. Hammond.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And _I_ claim the right of choosing my own escort,” said Anna, proudly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander bowed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Girl and boy, I will have no lovers’ quarrels here, Anna, you should\\r\\n\\n\\nfeel that there is an impropriety in an engaged young lady accepting the\\r\\n\\n\\nattentions of another gentleman, when her betrothed is anxious to show\\r\\n\\n\\nher those attentions himself. Alexander, you are to take Anna to the\\r\\n\\n\\nreception this evening. Young people, both see that you obey me. _Some_\\r\\n\\n\\nrespect should be paid to my gray head and my eighty years,” said the\\r\\n\\n\\nold soldier, with dignity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBoth the young people bowed and acquiesced. And so it was settled that\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander should attend Anna to the reception of the evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                          A QUEEN OF FASHION.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                 Here high-born men were proud to wait,\\r\\n\\n\\n                 And beauty watched to imitate\\r\\n\\n\\n                   Her gentle voice, her lovely mien,\\r\\n\\n\\n                 And gather from her air and gait\\r\\n\\n\\n                   The graces of its queen.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander went with his uncle and cousin to their hotel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, my boy,” said the old gentleman, after he had dismissed the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage and taken his grand-daughter into the private entrance, “let us\\r\\n\\n\\nlose no time in going to the office and securing your rooms. Guests are\\r\\n\\n\\narriving by every train, and the house is in a fair way of being crowded\\r\\n\\n\\nif it is not so already. Indeed, I fear you may not, even now, be able\\r\\n\\n\\nto obtain rooms here.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Heaven grant I may not!” was the fervent, though silent, aspiration of\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon, who was almost at his wits’ ends with perplexity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the strong hope that there was no room to be had, he let his uncle\\r\\n\\n\\ndrag him along to the counter of the office, which was crowded with\\r\\n\\n\\napplicants for accommodations. It was some minutes before General Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\ncould get audience with the sorely embarrassed clerk of the house. When\\r\\n\\n\\nhe did, it was to receive the answer that the crowded state of the\\r\\n\\n\\noffice led him to anticipate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was not a room nor a half a room, nor a bed nor a half a bed, at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe disposal of the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I thought so. Well, Alick, I am sorry; but you must try to get rooms as\\r\\n\\n\\nnear us as possible. I don’t think the Blank House is full yet. It is\\r\\n\\n\\ntoo far up town for strangers. But hark ye! it will be full in an hour\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom this time. ‘Make hay while the sun shines.’ Run, now; jump into a\\r\\n\\n\\ncab and drive for life to the Blank, and engage your rooms before this\\r\\n\\n\\ncrowd gets there and tills the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAgain, what could Alexander do? He saw at a glance that he must\\r\\n\\n\\nostensively live at Washington—that he must have rooms at some hotel,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough he might never, or very seldom, occupy them. And he was only too\\r\\n\\n\\nglad that he was not obliged to have rooms in the same house with his\\r\\n\\n\\nuncle, and so be always under the old gentleman’s eye.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe thanked General Lyon for his advice, and said that he should avail\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself of it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he went out and jumped into the first cab that offered, and drove to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Blank House, where he happened to be in time to engage the only\\r\\n\\n\\nbedroom at the disposal of the proprietor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe took the key of his room, which he meant only to occupy on his\\r\\n\\n\\noccasional visits to the city, and then he drove to the “establishment”\\r\\n\\n\\nof a fashionable tailor and gentleman’s outfitter, and he suited himself\\r\\n\\n\\nwith a full evening dress, including linen, gloves, perfumery, et\\r\\n\\n\\ncetera. These he ordered to be sent to his room at the Blank House.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am booked for his Excellency’s reception this evening, and so it will\\r\\n\\n\\nbe considerably after midnight before I can hope to get back to\\r\\n\\n\\nCedarwood. Poor little Drusa! I hope she won’t be anxious, and sit up\\r\\n\\n\\nand lose her rest,” he said, as he hurried back to his hotel to make his\\r\\n\\n\\ntoilet for the evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile waiting for his parcel from the tailor’s he lounged into the\\r\\n\\n\\nreading room, and took up one of the evening papers; but its columns\\r\\n\\n\\ncould scarcely engage his attention, which was wholly engrossed by his\\r\\n\\n\\nembarrassments.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is now near sunset,” so ran his thoughts, “and poor little soul! she\\r\\n\\n\\nhas been watching for me for hours, is watching for me at this moment,\\r\\n\\n\\nand will watch for me for hours longer, until long after midnight,\\r\\n\\n\\ntormented by nobody knows how many fears and fancies concerning me.\\r\\n\\n\\nPlague take the old man! what brought him bothering to Washington just\\r\\n\\n\\nat this time?” very irreverently muttered Mr. Lyon to himself, as his\\r\\n\\n\\neyes ran over the news items of the paper without taking cognizance of\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir meaning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis ostensible reading and his real reverie was rudely interrupted by\\r\\n\\n\\nthe clap of a hand upon his shoulder, and the ring of a laugh in his\\r\\n\\n\\near.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe turned sharply around and recognized Captain Reding and Lieutenant\\r\\n\\n\\nHarpe, two young officers of the army, who had been among the visitors\\r\\n\\n\\nto his box on the evening when he had taken Drusilla to the German\\r\\n\\n\\nOpera.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe bowed coldly in rebuke to their laughter, but they took no offence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hey, old boy! so here you are at last!” said Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“We have been looking for you for days—ever since we saw you at the\\r\\n\\n\\nGerman Opera with that pretty little girl,” said Harpe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where have you been hiding yourself all this time?” inquired Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And above all, where have you hidden that little beauty, you churlish\\r\\n\\n\\nfellow?” added Harpe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You never presented us to her,” said Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! we owe you one for that,” added Harpe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” answered Mr. Lyon, slowly and coldly collecting his\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughts, “if you will be good enough to speak, one at a time, and\\r\\n\\n\\nforbear a second question until a first is answered, perhaps I may be\\r\\n\\n\\nable to satisfy your curiosity. On the evening to which you allude I\\r\\n\\n\\nhappened to be passing through Washington, having in my charge the\\r\\n\\n\\ndaughter of a clergyman. She was the very young lady whom you saw with\\r\\n\\n\\nme at the opera. I made no stay in the city beyond that evening; but\\r\\n\\n\\ntook my young charge immediately to her home.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in this statement also Mr. Lyon told something near the literal\\r\\n\\n\\ntruth, while intentionally giving a false impression.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, well,” said Reding, “but why did you not introduce us to the little\\r\\n\\n\\nbeauty?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you must have it, I did not think two gay young blades like\\r\\n\\n\\nyourselves very desirable acquaintances for a clergyman’s daughter,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Mr. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you were!—oh! oh! oh!” laughed Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Deuce take it, what do you mean by that, Alick?” inquired Mr. Harpe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nothing against your honor, gentlemen. If my charge for the evening had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen any other young lady in the world, I would have presented you to\\r\\n\\n\\nher.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Much obliged,” said Reding; “but to tell you the truth, Lyon, whether\\r\\n\\n\\nyou like it or not, the young person in question did not impress us as\\r\\n\\n\\nbeing a young lady.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean by _that_?” exclaimed Mr. Lyon, in a low, stern voice,\\r\\n\\n\\nas he glared at the speaker.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, nothing against _her_ honor—nothing in the world. I mean simply\\r\\n\\n\\nthat the little creature seemed to us to be, not exactly of ‘low birth,’\\r\\n\\n\\nbut of ‘humble parentage,’ as the phrase goes. She had not the manners\\r\\n\\n\\nof good society,” answered Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Heaven forbid she ever should have,” said Alexander, firmly. And yet\\r\\n\\n\\nthe criticism galled him; all the more, perhaps, because he felt it to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe the truth. His lovely young wife had not, as these critics said, the\\r\\n\\n\\nmanners of “good society.” Yet it was hard to say what she lacked.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhatever it was, it was something in which Miss Anna Lyon, a very queen\\r\\n\\n\\nin society, excelled. What was it, then? Drusilla was pretty, graceful,\\r\\n\\n\\nwell educated, and well-dressed. She excelled in many accomplishments,\\r\\n\\n\\nand was conversant with the history of the past and the literature of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe present, and she conversed intelligently upon all these. She was\\r\\n\\n\\nsweet, gentle and courteous in her deportment to all persons. What then\\r\\n\\n\\ndid she lack? I will tell you—self-esteem and self-possession—both of\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich qualities are in high favor in “good society.” Drusilla’s manner\\r\\n\\n\\nwas that of one who had always occupied a subordinate position by living\\r\\n\\n\\namong her superiors. She had too little of assurance and too much of\\r\\n\\n\\ndeference.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd this delicate and retiring manner, which had been one of her\\r\\n\\n\\nsweetest charms in the eyes of her lover, now suddenly became\\r\\n\\n\\nobjectionable in the estimation of her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No,” he muttered to himself, “she has _not_ the air of a lady; she has\\r\\n\\n\\nthe air of a maid-servant. Poor little thing! I fear I shall never be\\r\\n\\n\\nable to introduce her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No offence, I hope, Alick!” said young Harpe, good-humoredly, noticing\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon’s gloomy abstraction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“None in the world,” answered Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because, if there should be, I am ready to fight or apologize, or to\\r\\n\\n\\ngive you any sort of satisfaction you may please to demand,” laughed the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung lieutenant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I ask as a favor that you will drop the subject of this young lady; for\\r\\n\\n\\nshe is a lady by position, if not—according to your judgment—in manners.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd now, gentlemen, as I have an engagement, I must wish you good\\r\\n\\n\\nevening,” said Mr. Lyon, bowing and withdrawing from their proximity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No,” he said, as he went slowly up to his room, “I must not bring\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla into public again. Her beauty excites attention and her\\r\\n\\n\\nsimplicity provokes criticism, and both raise questions difficult to\\r\\n\\n\\nmeet. Poor little Drusa, she must always be a hidden treasure, a secret\\r\\n\\n\\n‘well-spring of joy’ to me. Well, she will not object to that, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be all the lovelier and the sweeter for this seclusion,” he added,\\r\\n\\n\\nin some self-satisfaction, as he entered his room and began to dress for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs soon as he was ready he went down to the dining-room, took a single\\r\\n\\n\\ncup of strong tea, and then passed out to the sidewalk and called the\\r\\n\\n\\nbest-looking cab that he saw upon the stand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA short drive took him to the hotel where his uncle and cousin were\\r\\n\\n\\nstopping. He was shown up into their private parlor, where they were\\r\\n\\n\\nawaiting him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are late, Alick,” said Anna, advancing from the fire to meet him\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf way across the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I had to wait for my parcels,” replied Alexander, bowing and smiling\\r\\n\\n\\napologetically.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, your luggage from the railway station? Well, the porters _are_\\r\\n\\n\\nslow, that is certain; but then they have so much to do,” said old\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon, drawing a natural inference.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander bowed in an absent sort of a manner, but did not reply. He was\\r\\n\\n\\ngazing at his cousin. How grandly beautiful she looked, how graceful,\\r\\n\\n\\nhow stately! Ah! _she_ had the air, not only of “good society,” but of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe best society! And that upstart puppy, that good for nothing Dick\\r\\n\\n\\nHammond, to aspire to her. Ugh!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSuch was the tenor of Mr. Alexander’s thoughts as he stood for a moment\\r\\n\\n\\ncontemplating his beautiful and imperious-looking cousin. In fact, Anna\\r\\n\\n\\nwas at an age when every season added to her beauty. Always\\r\\n\\n\\nwell-looking, she had never in her life looked so well as to-night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe wore a deep mourning full dress of black crape, over a black silk.\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was made with a low corsage and short sleeves; both sleeves and\\r\\n\\n\\ncorsage were edged with a narrow trimming of fine white thule; and the\\r\\n\\n\\nfairness of her perfect neck and arms were set off by a necklace and\\r\\n\\n\\nbracelets of jet. Her golden auburn hair was in plain rolls at the back\\r\\n\\n\\nof her head, and a band of jet above her forehead was its only ornament.\\r\\n\\n\\nThis simple mourning dress set off her blonde beauty more completely\\r\\n\\n\\nthan the most elaborate toilet could have done.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am ready, Alick. What are you waiting for?” she inquired, breaking in\\r\\n\\n\\nupon the spell that bound him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nothing,” he answered, with a slight start. “I am at your service this\\r\\n\\n\\ninstant.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he stepped towards her, and fastened the glove on the hand that she\\r\\n\\n\\nheld out to him. And then he wrapped her opera cloak carefully around\\r\\n\\n\\nher shoulders, tied the little hood under her chin, drew her arm within\\r\\n\\n\\nhis own, and led her from the room down to the carriage, wondering all\\r\\n\\n\\nthe way how it was that his cousin Anna, whom he had only known as a\\r\\n\\n\\nrather pretty girl so long, should so suddenly have become so beautiful\\r\\n\\n\\nin his eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh! Mr. Lyon, she had grown beautiful to you only in becoming\\r\\n\\n\\nunattainable by you. A common case.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld General Lyon followed them closely, and saw Alick put Anna into her\\r\\n\\n\\nseat, and tuck her wrappings carefully around her, and then get in and\\r\\n\\n\\nplace himself beside her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Take care of her, Alick; the night is growing colder,” said the old\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall take the best care of her, sir,” replied Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anna, mind, you are not to stay late,” said Anna’s grandfather.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Late?’—Who stays late at a President’s reception? Everybody—that is,\\r\\n\\n\\nalmost everybody, leaves before twelve. I shall be back by half-past\\r\\n\\n\\neleven, sir. It is only to make one’s bow or courtesy to his Excellency\\r\\n\\n\\nin the Reception Room, and walk once or twice through the East Room, and\\r\\n\\n\\ncome away,” laughed Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very well, I shall sit up for you,” said General Lyon, by way of\\r\\n\\n\\nsealing the bargain, as he retreated from the carriage door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coachman put up the steps, clapped to the door, mounted his box, and\\r\\n\\n\\ndrove off.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\n\\n                             MORAL MADNESS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                    And she was all forgotten,\\r\\n\\n\\n                      Amid the dazzling hall,\\r\\n\\n\\n                    Amid the thundering music\\r\\n\\n\\n                      And maddening carnival.—ANON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I was so upset by what you told me, Anna, that I really forgot to ask\\r\\n\\n\\nyou how long you have been in the city,” said Alexander, as soon as the\\r\\n\\n\\nhorses were in motion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“We have been here just four days,” answered Miss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have not been out much?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; my grandfather has a crotchet that one must make one’s first\\r\\n\\n\\nappearance in public at the President’s reception. This is the first one\\r\\n\\n\\nthat has been held since our arrival, and consequently the first evening\\r\\n\\n\\nthat I have been out.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very fortunate in being here to go with you,” said Alexander, this\\r\\n\\n\\ntime speaking, to his shame, quite truly; for he _was_ glad to escort\\r\\n\\n\\nhis beautiful cousin, if only to prevent Richard Hammond from doing so.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks,” she answered, very coldly, as if not believing his statement,\\r\\n\\n\\nor not valuing it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe very short distance between the hotel they had left and the palace\\r\\n\\n\\nto which they were going was soon accomplished, and the carriage was\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawn up in the rear of some fifty others that occupied the drive\\r\\n\\n\\nleading to the doors of the Executive mansion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There seems to be a great crowd here to-night,” said Alexander, while\\r\\n\\n\\nthey waited their turn to drive up to the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There is always a crowd here in the month of February, I believe. It is\\r\\n\\n\\nin this month that the city is full of strangers—literally _full_,\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick,” replied Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was twenty minutes before their carriage slowly worked its way up\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore the main entrance of the mansion. Then Alexander handed his\\r\\n\\n\\ncompanion down from her seat, and took her up the broad steps leading\\r\\n\\n\\ninto the front hall of the palace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA President’s reception has been described so often that there is no\\r\\n\\n\\nneed of a description here.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe reception of this evening in its general features differed from none\\r\\n\\n\\nof its predecessors or its successors. There was the same crowd of\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriages on the drive, the same stream of foot passengers on the walk,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the same crush of guests in the hall, in the cloak rooms, in the\\r\\n\\n\\ncorridors, in the ante-rooms, in the audience-chamber, in the reception\\r\\n\\n\\nroom, and in the east drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHaving each deposited their outer wrappings respectively in the\\r\\n\\n\\ngentlemen’s and the ladies’ cloak rooms, Alexander and Anna met at the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor of the latter. He drew her arm within his own, and they soon found\\r\\n\\n\\nthemselves in a crush of crinoline and broadcloth, and an atmosphere of\\r\\n\\n\\npatchoula frangipani, being forced forward through the corridor and the\\r\\n\\n\\nante-room into the reception room. In due time they were pressed up to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe presence of the President and his suite; but they had scarcely made\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir respective bow and courtesy, and touched his Excellency’s hand,\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore they were carried onward through other rooms into the east\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing-room, where they found a little more space and freedom of\\r\\n\\n\\nmotion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA military hand was playing a national march, to the measure of which\\r\\n\\n\\nnearly half the company were promenading in a procession around and\\r\\n\\n\\naround the saloon in a manner which, to a new comer, must have looked\\r\\n\\n\\nsimply idiotic.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOthers of the assembly were seated on the various sofas and divans that\\r\\n\\n\\nlined the walls of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will you take a seat or a promenade?” inquired Alexander of his\\r\\n\\n\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, a promenade, by all means,” replied Anna. “I like the perfect\\r\\n\\n\\nvacuity of mind that falls upon one in that orbit.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander drew her arm closer within his own, and they fell into the\\r\\n\\n\\nprocession. Immediately before them walked a foreign minister, in his\\r\\n\\n\\nofficial costume, conducting a lady of high rank and fashion.\\r\\n\\n\\nImmediately behind them came a general officer with a reigning belle\\r\\n\\n\\nupon his arm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the reign of this belle was over from this evening. Her successor\\r\\n\\n\\nhad arrived.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander and Anna had not made the circuit of the room twice, before he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaw that his companion was, “the observed of all observers” in the\\r\\n\\n\\nplace. He saw eyeglasses levelled at her; he heard whispered questions\\r\\n\\n\\nconcerning her:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who is she, that beautiful girl in black crape and jet?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he heard the whispered answers:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A new debutante in the beau monde, I fancy.” Or—\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know, but that is young Lyon, of Richmond, who is escorting\\r\\n\\n\\nher.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Splendid woman!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Magnificent creature!” Etc., etc., etc.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he saw and heard all this, Alexander was strongly affected with\\r\\n\\n\\ncontradictory emotions. If the beautiful girl by his side had been\\r\\n\\n\\nundisputably his own, he might have witnessed the sensation she created,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith unmixed pride and pleasure. But he had by his own rash act, lost\\r\\n\\n\\nhis own once exclusive right over her, and even put himself beyond the\\r\\n\\n\\ncircle of ordinary aspirants for her favor. And now the universal\\r\\n\\n\\nadmiration her beauty excited, aroused his dog-in-the-manger jealousy,\\r\\n\\n\\nrather than flattered his pride.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd, upon the whole, not liking the situation, he stooped and whispered\\r\\n\\n\\nto his cousin:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Shall I lead you to a seat now, Anna?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please,” she answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he took her to a distant sofa, gave her the corner of it, and placed\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself by her side.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut he gained nothing by the motion. On the contrary, he lost.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNo sooner were they seated, than up came Richard Hammond, confident and\\r\\n\\n\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna received him with the utmost graciousness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he stood before her, talking and laughing with her very gaily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOther gentlemen friends, whom Anna had met on former occasions, came up\\r\\n\\n\\nand paid their respects, and lingered near her. Her lady friends, a few\\r\\n\\n\\nof whom were present, also sought her out, and greeted her with much\\r\\n\\n\\napparent gladness, and introduced _their_ friends to her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was not room on the sofa for all these ladies. So Anna, deeming it\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscourteous to sit, where so many were standing, arose from her seat\\r\\n\\n\\nand stood up. And very soon a circle of the most distinguished men and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe most brilliant women in the assembly was formed around her. And she\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed as a queen, receiving the homage of her court.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently, a general buzz in the crowd announced some interesting event,\\r\\n\\n\\nand before the little excitement subsided, the commanding form of the\\r\\n\\n\\nPresident was seen passing with his suite through the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn due course, he drew near the circle that surrounded Miss Lyon. On\\r\\n\\n\\nseeing that young beauty, he immediately passed through the circle that\\r\\n\\n\\ndivided to admit him, and stood before her, holding out his hand, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsaying, in a fatherly and familiar manner:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How do you do, my dear? I am very glad to see you here, this evening.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut where is my old friend, the General?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon, with a deep courtesy, explained that her grandfather’s\\r\\n\\n\\nprecarious state of health deprived him of the honor of waiting on his\\r\\n\\n\\nExcellency.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe President expressed his regret at this. And then instead of passing\\r\\n\\n\\non and dispensing his courtesies impartially among his guests, he\\r\\n\\n\\nlingered near the beautiful Anna, apparently as much fascinated by her\\r\\n\\n\\ncharms, as the youngest man in his presence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFull half an hour he stood talking with the beauty, and then reluctantly\\r\\n\\n\\nbowed his adieux, and immediately left the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis seemed the signal for the breaking up of the assembly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then followed other leave-takings, and the pressure through the\\r\\n\\n\\ncorridors to the cloak rooms; and the confusion of tongues and of\\r\\n\\n\\nproperties there, and the crush in the hall, and finally, the escape\\r\\n\\n\\ninto pure, bracing air of the clear starlight night on the outside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander and Anna had to wait the turn of their carriage to drive up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen, at length, they were comfortably seated within it, Alexander took\\r\\n\\n\\nout his watch, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Half-past twelve o’clock, and we promised to be home at half-past\\r\\n\\n\\neleven. We have kept your grandfather waiting for an hour.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he thought with compunction of one other whom he had kept waiting\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch more than an hour.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were driven rapidly to the hotel. On their arrival, Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nhelped Anna out of the carriage and hurried her into the house, for the\\r\\n\\n\\nnight was sharp.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey found General Lyon up, and expecting them, with much impatience.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“An hour behind time, Anna,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The President detained me in conversation, to the envy of all his other\\r\\n\\n\\nlady guests,” laughed Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you will forgive her delay,” said Alexander, “in consequence of her\\r\\n\\n\\nconquest of our President. I consider it a great success.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                              A DARK RIDE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n        As yet ’tis midnight deep, the weary clouds,\\r\\n\\n\\n        Slow meeting, mingle into solemn gloom,\\r\\n\\n\\n        The while the drowsy world lies lost in sleep.—THOMSON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs soon as Alexander Lyon had bid good night to his uncle and cousin, he\\r\\n\\n\\nhurried to the livery stable where he had left his horse, doubting that\\r\\n\\n\\nit would be open at so late an hour.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut it was not yet closed for the night; so upon Mr. Lyon’s requirement\\r\\n\\n\\none of the hostlers led out the horse, already saddled and bridled for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe road.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A dark night, sir,” said this official, as he put the reins in the\\r\\n\\n\\nhands of the rider.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, and a dark road before me,” replied the young gentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope for your sake it isn’t a long one, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is about five miles directly in the face of the wind,” laughed Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sorry to hear it on your account, sir. The weather’s sharpish. The\\r\\n\\n\\nwind’s got round to the northud and blows up pretty keenish. I wish you\\r\\n\\n\\nwell at your journey’s end, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. Good night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good night, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander rode briskly away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe night had grown bitterly cold; but his horse was fresh, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nrider thought that in such weather as this it would do the beast no harm\\r\\n\\n\\nto ride him hard. So he put him into a gallop, and soon left the\\r\\n\\n\\ngas-lighted, populous streets behind, and found himself in a dark and\\r\\n\\n\\nlonely road, where nothing was to be seen on either side but wintry\\r\\n\\n\\nwoods and stubble fields, frozen brooks and straggling fences, and at\\r\\n\\n\\nlong intervals some isolated dwelling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length he came to the old turnpike road leading through the woods\\r\\n\\n\\ntowards his home. Here it was necessary to slacken speed; for the road\\r\\n\\n\\nwas obstructed in many places, and the sky was very dark. So he drew\\r\\n\\n\\nrein at the entrance of the wood, and went on in a walk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNotwithstanding the rapidity with which he had galloped over the five\\r\\n\\n\\nmiles on the Seventh street road, his blood was half stagnant with the\\r\\n\\n\\ncold. His face, after smarting fiercely in the wind had lost all sense\\r\\n\\n\\nof feeling, and his hands were so numb that he could scarcely hold the\\r\\n\\n\\nbridle.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn addition to his physical discomfort he experienced much mental\\r\\n\\n\\ndisturbance; and both together made him irritable and angry with himself\\r\\n\\n\\nand all the world. He was vexed with his uncle and cousin for being in\\r\\n\\n\\nWashington: with Richard Hammond for being always at hand to wait upon\\r\\n\\n\\nthe beautiful heiress; with the old man in Brazil for dying and leaving\\r\\n\\n\\nthe young spendthrift a fortune to recommend him; and, above all, with\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself—not exactly for having married poor little Drusilla, but\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainly for having by his own act put it out of his power to marry\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna; and _worse_ than all, he was vexed in advance with his sweet\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle wife for the reception he felt sure she would give him when he\\r\\n\\n\\nshould get home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he rode slowly through the woods he muttered to himself:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I _know_ she has been watching for me ever since noon to-day, just\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause I said that I would be home then. She has been watching more\\r\\n\\n\\nthan twelve hours. And now of course she has worried herself into a fit\\r\\n\\n\\nof intense anxiety, and most likely of illness besides. And there she\\r\\n\\n\\nis, no doubt, sitting with a pale face and red eyes, weeping over a\\r\\n\\n\\nsmouldering fire, or an extinguished one. And she will meet me either\\r\\n\\n\\nwith tears or sorrowful reproaches, or both! And, after all, what can I\\r\\n\\n\\nsay for myself? Ah, bah, why will women take such things so much to\\r\\n\\n\\nheart? As if it was not enough to have been driven almost to mental\\r\\n\\n\\ndistraction for her sake to-day, without being subjected to a scene\\r\\n\\n\\nto-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo growling within himself, the culprit rode slowly onward towards his\\r\\n\\n\\nhome, and the nearer he got to it the more slowly he rode. He actually\\r\\n\\n\\ndreaded to meet Drusilla. But ride on slowly as he might, he could not\\r\\n\\n\\nput off forever the inevitable moment of arrival.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe soon saw the light of his home gleaming through the trees.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There, I knew it!” he said to himself. “She _is_ sitting up for me.\\r\\n\\n\\nThere are the drawing-room windows all ablaze, and not a shutter closed.\\r\\n\\n\\nI had a faint hope that she might have gone to bed and cried herself to\\r\\n\\n\\nsleep, like a child as she is. But that’s all over now. I’ve got to meet\\r\\n\\n\\nher with her red eyes and pale face. Confound it all, if she does get up\\r\\n\\n\\na scene, I’ll teach her a lesson she’ll not soon forget!” he growled,\\r\\n\\n\\ntrying to work himself up into a fit of rage in anticipation of the\\r\\n\\n\\ndreaded meeting. And yet, in the midst of all his efforts, his heart\\r\\n\\n\\nreproached him, and he relented a little towards his young wife. So now\\r\\n\\n\\nit was half in anger and half in compunction he drew near his home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTo give himself more time, to postpone the evil hour as long as\\r\\n\\n\\npossible, he first rode around to the stable to put up his horse\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then he walked slowly to the house and knocked at the front door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt flew open on the instant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd there stood Drusilla, warm, glad, beaming with delight, radiant with\\r\\n\\n\\nwelcome.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I heard you come,” she exclaimed—“I heard you ride around to the stable\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst, and so I was here ready to open for you. But oh! how cold you\\r\\n\\n\\nlook. Come in quickly,” she said, taking him by his frozen hands and\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing him into the hall, and then closing and bolting the front door\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her own nimble fingers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor an instant he was so “taken aback” by her unexpected manner that he\\r\\n\\n\\npositively shrank from her. But the next moment he caught her and folded\\r\\n\\n\\nher to his bosom, as he murmured:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My darling, darling child! My own dearest and best little Drusilla! how\\r\\n\\n\\ncould I ever leave you! Heart of my heart, I will never leave you again\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a whole day alone as long as I live in this world.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nRash vow! but he meant, at the moment, to keep it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that is what I am,” she whispered—“heart of your heart. That is\\r\\n\\n\\nthe sweetest and the truest name you ever called me. And now let me help\\r\\n\\n\\nyou off with your overcoat, and then you can come into the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\nThere is a good fire.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe let her assist him in taking off his coat, and then he followed her\\r\\n\\n\\ninto the drawing-room, where, as she had said, there was a good fire.\\r\\n\\n\\nHis easy chair was standing before it, and his furred slippers were\\r\\n\\n\\nlying on the rug. And she had even brought down the boot-jack and laid\\r\\n\\n\\nit by the slippers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNear the easy chair stood a small round table, covered with a white\\r\\n\\n\\ndamask cloth and laid for two persons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA bright tea-kettle sat singing before the fire, and two small silver\\r\\n\\n\\ncovered dishes sat upon the hearth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSeeing these simple preparations for his comfort and seeing the happy\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle creature who had made them, his heart smote him, first for having\\r\\n\\n\\nleft her alone so late, and then for having entertained such hard\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughts of her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My darling child, how kind of you to do all this for me. But I am sorry\\r\\n\\n\\nyou took the trouble,” he said, putting his arm around her and drawing\\r\\n\\n\\nher towards him where he sat in his resting chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But suppose it made me happy to do it? Suppose it interested and amused\\r\\n\\n\\nme while waiting for you?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, ‘waiting’ indeed! how long you have waited! I was in hopes that you\\r\\n\\n\\nhad gone to bed and gone to sleep; but when I saw the lights in the\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing-room windows, I knew that you were still up.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I left the shutters open on purpose; I thought the light would look\\r\\n\\n\\ncheerful to you as you rode home through the woods.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear heart! I ought to have known your loving motive as I came along;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut I didn’t. Ah, weren’t you tired and sleepy with waiting?” he asked,\\r\\n\\n\\nas he drew her on his knee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why no. It is not so _very_ late, after all. And I have sat up many and\\r\\n\\n\\nmany a night later than this only to finish a piece of needle-work I\\r\\n\\n\\nhappened to be pleased with, or book I was interested in. And wouldn’t I\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch sooner sit up to give my dearest a good warm supper after his long,\\r\\n\\n\\ncold ride?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My pet, my love, my darling, my—oh! what can I call you that will be\\r\\n\\n\\ngood enough and dear enough for you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Call me no hard names at all,” she said, gayly, kissing him and\\r\\n\\n\\nspringing from his lap. “But take off your boots while I put supper on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe table.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPoor little Drusilla, these arrangements of hers were not according to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe usages of “good society.” Now, Anna Lyon would have let her husband\\r\\n\\n\\ngo up to the top of the house in the cold before she would have\\r\\n\\n\\npermitted the boot-jack to be brought into the drawing-room; and would\\r\\n\\n\\nhave let him broken his fast in a dreary dining-room, or even gone\\r\\n\\n\\nhungry and thirsty to bed, before she would have allowed a kettle to be\\r\\n\\n\\nboiled, or a supper to be laid, in the drawing-room. And only a few\\r\\n\\n\\nhours before this Alexander had been lamenting in his heart his little\\r\\n\\n\\nwife’s deficiencies in the manners of “good society.” But now he was\\r\\n\\n\\nhungry and cold, and so,—flagrant as her breach of etiquette was, he did\\r\\n\\n\\nnot seem to see it; he only realized that he was at this moment the\\r\\n\\n\\nhappiest man, with the loveliest wife, in existence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe supper was soon placed upon the table. Of the two silver covered\\r\\n\\n\\ndishes, one was found to contain a pair of nicely roasted partridges,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the other equally well roasted potatoes. Besides these, there was a\\r\\n\\n\\nfresh salad prepared, as he thought none but Drusilla could prepare it.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd there were light biscuits and delicate jellies and fresh fruits. And\\r\\n\\n\\nthere were “schnapps” and lemons and loaf sugar, and all the materials\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the hot punch that she thought he would like after his cold ride.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tell me, darling,” said Alexander, after he had refreshed himself with\\r\\n\\n\\nthese viands, and was taking his ease between the table and the fire,\\r\\n\\n\\n“tell me how you have passed the lonely day. Were you very lonely and\\r\\n\\n\\nvery anxious?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No,” she answered, “I wasn’t lonely. I was very busy, and I was\\r\\n\\n\\nthinking of you, and looking for you. And—yes, I am forced to admit that\\r\\n\\n\\nI was a little anxious.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor child! I had promised to be home at noon. What did you think, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat did you do when I failed to come?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I thought something had detained you a little, and that you would be\\r\\n\\n\\nhome very soon; and—I took a cup of tea and bit of toast for lunch,”\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And afterwards, when hour after hour passed, until our late dinner time\\r\\n\\n\\ncame, what then?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I waited, expecting you every minute, until some hours past our\\r\\n\\n\\ndinner-time, and then—I ate my own dinner and had yours put away to be\\r\\n\\n\\nkept warm.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wise little girl.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I scarcely thought you would need the dinner. I fancied you were\\r\\n\\n\\ndining with some friend you had met in the city, and that _that_ was\\r\\n\\n\\nkeeping you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Little witch! And then when it grew dark and late?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, _then_ I grew a little nervous about you, and had ever so many\\r\\n\\n\\nfoolish imaginations—that robbers had attacked you on the dark road, or\\r\\n\\n\\nthat the horse had thrown you, or some other fatality had overtaken you;\\r\\n\\n\\nand so I was troubled with anxiety. But I reasoned and fought against\\r\\n\\n\\nthat anxiety. I said to myself how much more likely it was that you were\\r\\n\\n\\nspending the evening with some friend; and then I recollected that the\\r\\n\\n\\nItalian Opera was in Washington, and I thought it most probable that you\\r\\n\\n\\nhad gone there.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! well, and what next?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, about ten o’clock I called in Pina and told her as the night was\\r\\n\\n\\nso sharp, and the ride so long, you would need a warm supper when you\\r\\n\\n\\nshould arrive; and that we must get one up between us for you. And so\\r\\n\\n\\nPina dressed the partridges, and I made the salad and set the table,\\r\\n\\n\\nand—that was how it was. And when all was ready I made Pina and Leo go\\r\\n\\n\\nto bed, because the poor creatures have to rise so early in the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd I told them to leave the shutters open, that the light might be a\\r\\n\\n\\nbeacon to you on this dark night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My darling, darling child! I always knew that your nature was as sweet\\r\\n\\n\\nas a saint’s, but I never knew how heavenly sweet, until to-night! You\\r\\n\\n\\nhave given me such loving welcome! You have not even _looked_ a reproach\\r\\n\\n\\nto me for disappointing you, and you have not once asked me why I did\\r\\n\\n\\nit.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe stopped his words with kisses. And with her arm around his neck, and\\r\\n\\n\\nher cheek laid against his, she whispered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As if I hadn’t faith in you. As if I didn’t love you and trust you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you dove! I would not give you for Anna Lyon and all the fine\\r\\n\\n\\nladies that live, or ever did, or ever will live!” he said, warmly\\r\\n\\n\\nembracing her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope,” she whispered, softly, “that you would never wish to give me\\r\\n\\n\\nup for any one; not that I am better than others; not that I am so good\\r\\n\\n\\nas they; but because I am your own, and you love me. But what made you\\r\\n\\n\\nthink of Miss Lyon just then, dearest?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, because, you know, it was planned between our parents, that Anna\\r\\n\\n\\nand I should marry, whether we liked to do it or not; fortunately,\\r\\n\\n\\nneither of us liked to do it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Fortunately;’ oh yes, how very fortunately! I cannot bear to think\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat I should have done, if you had married Miss Lyon,” said Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith a shudder.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander wished to divert the conversation from the dangerous topic to\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich he had so thoughtlessly led it, so he said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you thought I had gone to the Italian Opera, this evening, did you,\\r\\n\\n\\nmy little love?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I thought you had dined with some friend, and then had gone with\\r\\n\\n\\nhim to see Lucia di’ Lammermoor. Had you not?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, my darling, no; I wouldn’t have left you alone all the evening, for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe sake of hearing the grandest opera ever written and played.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wouldn’t you, Alick? But you might have done so. I shouldn’t have\\r\\n\\n\\nthought hard of it. I couldn’t expect you to be tied down to me all the\\r\\n\\n\\ntime.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, my darling, I wouldn’t have, broken faith with you and stayed\\r\\n\\n\\naway, when I promised to be home, for any amusement under the sun. And\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing but the most urgent necessity should have kept me away on this\\r\\n\\n\\noccasion.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear Alick, nothing disagreeable to you, I hope?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Only disagreeable, love, in so far as it detained me from your side.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I am glad.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It was only—some unexpected business connected with my late father’s\\r\\n\\n\\nwill,” said Alexander, hesitatingly, and again speaking a literal truth\\r\\n\\n\\nto give a false impression. For certainly his embarrassments with Anna\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon did grow out of his father’s will—will that he, Alexander, should\\r\\n\\n\\nmarry her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Drusilla understood him as speaking in a financial sense only—as he\\r\\n\\n\\nintended that she should; and she brightened up and answered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, well, Alick, dear, since it was not very vexatious business, never\\r\\n\\n\\nmind if it _did_ keep you away from me a few hours longer than you or I\\r\\n\\n\\nexpected. I can not hope to have you always here beside me; but you are\\r\\n\\n\\nhere now; and all is made up to you, is it not?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, dear heart of my heart, all is made up to me now,” said Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\nfolding her fondly to his heart.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the night that he had dreaded so much closed in this perfect peace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\\r\\n\\n\\n                           A NEGLECTED WIFE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n               He saw proud Clara’s face more fair,\\r\\n\\n\\n               He knew her of broad lands the heir,\\r\\n\\n\\n               Forgot his vows, his faith foreswore,\\r\\n\\n\\n               And Constance was beloved no more.—SCOTT.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe day and night described in the last chapter were the types of many,\\r\\n\\n\\ntoo many days and nights that followed them. Alexander Lyon had placed\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself in a false position and had a very difficult part to play\\r\\n\\n\\nbetween his wife and his betrothed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn the morning after that little supper the young couple slept late;\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause on the previous evening they had found their bright fireside so\\r\\n\\n\\ndelightful that they had remained there billing and cooing like a pair\\r\\n\\n\\nof lovers, as they still were, until the small hours, when at length\\r\\n\\n\\nthey went to rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was the first of the two to rise in the morning; for she was an\\r\\n\\n\\nardent little housewife, and she liked to have everything about her\\r\\n\\n\\nsmall home in perfect order.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe slept on until noon, and then awoke with a weight upon his mind,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough a very vague idea of what it meant. But presently, as his brain\\r\\n\\n\\ngrew clearer, he remembered all the perplexing events of the preceding\\r\\n\\n\\nday and cursed his fate for bringing him into such an embarrassing\\r\\n\\n\\nposition.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he made his morning toilet he reflected that his uncle, an “early\\r\\n\\n\\nbird,” like most old country gentlemen, had probably some hours before\\r\\n\\n\\nthis called at his room at the Blank House and found him absent, and\\r\\n\\n\\nperhaps had been told by the servants there that he had not been in all\\r\\n\\n\\nnight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat could the old gentleman think of such irregularity on the part of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis nephew and intended son-in-law?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander scarcely dared to answer that question. But full of anxious\\r\\n\\n\\nand perplexing thoughts, he finished his toilet and went below stairs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the breakfast room he found a fine fire, a neat table, and his lovely\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung wife in her pretty morning dress of white merino with black\\r\\n\\n\\ntrimmings.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe put aside the book she had been reading and arose to receive him. He\\r\\n\\n\\nkissed her in silence and then dropped heavily into his chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe rang the bell and ordered breakfast served.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope you have not waited for me, dear?” he languidly remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; I had a cup of tea and a bit of dry toast when I first came down;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut that was nine o’clock, and it is after one now; so I am quite ready\\r\\n\\n\\nto take breakfast with you. It will be my lunch.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFragrant Mocha coffee, fresh eggs, smoked salmon, broiled chicken and\\r\\n\\n\\nlight muffins were soon placed upon the table; and the two sat down to\\r\\n\\n\\nbreakfast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut tempting as the viands were that stood, before him, Alexander could\\r\\n\\n\\neat but little.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla noticed his want of appetite and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are not well, dear. Have you a head-ache? Shall I order some strong\\r\\n\\n\\ngreen tea made for you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Drusa; I never drink tea in the morning unless I am really sick.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd I am quite well now; except that I am a little disturbed in regard\\r\\n\\n\\nto—to that business connected with my late father’s will,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, evasively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, then it wasn’t settled yesterday?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no; and I fear it will not be for many days yet.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am sorry, Alick. But never mind. Everybody must have some little\\r\\n\\n\\nthing to vex them; but it can’t last forever, you know. Try a little bit\\r\\n\\n\\nof this smoked salmon. It is very nice.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTo please her he tried the salmon, and found that it gave him an\\r\\n\\n\\nappetite; and he made a better breakfast than he had expected to do.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen he had finished, he rang the bell, which summoned Leo to the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Have my horse saddled and brought around here directly,” he said to the\\r\\n\\n\\nboy. Then, turning to his wife, he added:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall have to ride into town to-day to look after that business; but\\r\\n\\n\\nI will try to be back before night. I hope you won’t be very lonesome,\\r\\n\\n\\ndear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAn involuntary expression of surprise and disappointment clouded her\\r\\n\\n\\nface for an instant; but she chased the clouds away, and smilingly\\r\\n\\n\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, I shall be very busy. But if you will tell me at what hour you\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be back, I will have dinner ready for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Have dinner at the usual hour, my dear. I will be back in time for it\\r\\n\\n\\nif I possibly can. But do not wait for me beyond five o’clock, do you\\r\\n\\n\\nhear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick,” she answered, and again she had to chase away a rising\\r\\n\\n\\ncloud of disappointment by a sunny smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe went out to prepare for his ride, and as soon as he was ready he\\r\\n\\n\\nkissed his young wife and begged her not to mope; and then he mounted\\r\\n\\n\\nhis horse, that stood saddled at the door, and rode briskly away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked after him until he was out of sight, and then with a sigh\\r\\n\\n\\nturned into the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile Alexander rode rapidly into the city, and, after leaving his\\r\\n\\n\\nhorse at the livery stable, hurried anxiously off to the hotel where his\\r\\n\\n\\nuncle and cousin were stopping, and sent up his card.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were both in, and he was soon ushered up into their private\\r\\n\\n\\nsitting-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon, reclining in his resting chair, was reading the morning\\r\\n\\n\\npapers; and Miss Lyon, lolling on the sofa, was turning over the leaves\\r\\n\\n\\nof the libretto of the opera of the evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander felt a little guilty as he walked into their presence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut he was instantly consoled and reassured by the manners of both old\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman and young lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, is that you, Alick? Good morning. Sit down. Excuse me for not\\r\\n\\n\\nrising. This is a shocking version of Il Trovatore,” said Anna, without\\r\\n\\n\\nmoving, or lifting her eyes from the pages she was studying.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! how do you do? Glad to see you. Intended to walk around your way\\r\\n\\n\\nthis morning and see how you were getting on. But really, in such sharp\\r\\n\\n\\nweather as this, it seems to require an effort to leave the chimney\\r\\n\\n\\ncorner. Hope you’ll excuse my not calling.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“With all my heart, sir,” said Alexander, feeling immensely relieved,\\r\\n\\n\\nand blessing his stars that his uncle had not called on him and\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovered his absence after all. “With all my heart, sir! I could not\\r\\n\\n\\nindeed expect, and would not wish you to take the trouble. It is rather\\r\\n\\n\\nmy duty always to wait upon you—a duty that I shall always be most happy\\r\\n\\n\\nto perform.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You’re a good lad, Alick, a good lad,” said the old soldier, frankly\\r\\n\\n\\nholding out his hand to his nephew.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope I shall always be so happy as to deserve your good opinion,\\r\\n\\n\\nsir,” said Alexander, taking the offered hand and bowing deeply over it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut as he lifted himself up again he encountered the laughing eyes of\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, who was regarding him with a mocking smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, really, Alick, you know you are growing so Joseph Surfacish, that\\r\\n\\n\\nI am beginning to doubt your sincerity,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander’s countenance fell. But the old gentleman came to the rescue.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Never mind her, Alick. Who ever does mind Anna? But listen to me. I\\r\\n\\n\\nhave made an engagement for you this evening.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander started, with an unpleasant sensation about his heart; but the\\r\\n\\n\\nold gentleman, without noticing him, went on:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There have been several parties calling here this morning, to invite\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna to go and hear this celebrated Italian Opera Troupe. But I excused\\r\\n\\n\\nher to one and all, telling them she was engaged to go with you, and\\r\\n\\n\\nalso giving them to understand that she was also engaged for life to\\r\\n\\n\\nyou, so that they might not waste any attentions upon her. And I sent\\r\\n\\n\\nand took a private box for you both, for this evening. Come! no thanks.\\r\\n\\n\\nI don’t desire any. It was perfectly convenient for me to make these\\r\\n\\n\\narrangements, to save you the trouble.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander was dumb-foundered; he could not have returned thanks if he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad tried. He dropped into the nearest seat, and wiped his face with his\\r\\n\\n\\nhandkerchief, while the old gentleman went on to describe the\\r\\n\\n\\nattractions of the Italian Opera, and while Anna silently, with an\\r\\n\\n\\namused expression of countenance, watched both.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I—I fear, sir, that I cannot have the honor intended for me. I—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n—“Cannot have the honor intended for you? What the mischief do you mean\\r\\n\\n\\nby that, sir?” demanded the old gentleman, in surprise and displeasure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A previous engagement, I regret to say, sir, stands in the way.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What sort of an engagement, boy? What sort of an engagement?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I had promised to dine with a friend—” began Alexander, speaking truly\\r\\n\\n\\nas to the letter, and falsely as to the spirit. But the old gentleman\\r\\n\\n\\nstopped him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, a friend! a gentleman, of course, for it isn’t possible that you\\r\\n\\n\\nshould have promised to dine with any lady. Bosh, boy! Send the man an\\r\\n\\n\\nexcuse; tell him here is a lady in the case; and take an early dinner\\r\\n\\n\\nwith us, and be ready to attend Anna.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Really, my dear grandfather, I wish you would not press this matter\\r\\n\\n\\nupon Mr. Lyon. You know that Dick is most anxious to be my escort,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon, in very justifiable displeasure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon and Dick. She called Alexander “Mr. Lyon,” and Richard Hammond\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick.” Alexander noticed the distinction, and his blood fired; but\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore he could say a word, the old gentleman, with a flushed brow,\\r\\n\\n\\nstruck in:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick? What the deuce do you mean, Anna? Do you suppose I am going to\\r\\n\\n\\nallow you to be gallanted about by Dick or any other man, for that\\r\\n\\n\\nmatter, to set people gossipping? You an engaged young lady! And you,\\r\\n\\n\\nsir!” he exclaimed, turning angrily to Alexander—“Thunder and lightning!\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat do _you_ mean, sir, by your excuses and your hesitations? Do you\\r\\n\\n\\nmean to slight your betrothed, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Heaven forbid!” answered Alexander, earnestly. “I told you the reason\\r\\n\\n\\nwhy I hesitated—that I had an engagement to dinner, but that\\r\\n\\n\\nengagement—every lighter engagement—shall give way to your will, sir,\\r\\n\\n\\nand my dear cousin’s service.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so saying he bowed to his uncle, and would have lifted his cousin’s\\r\\n\\n\\nhand to his lips, but that she drew it away with a mocking smile as she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks, Mr. ‘Joseph Surface.’ As I am resolved to see the opera, and as\\r\\n\\n\\nI cannot do so without your escort, I suppose I must accept it. Though I\\r\\n\\n\\ntell you plainly that I would much rather have Dick’s company.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anna!” exclaimed the general, again breaking in before Alexander could\\r\\n\\n\\nreply; “Anna, this is unbearable! to tell your betrothed husband that\\r\\n\\n\\nyou would rather have another man’s company than his!—But Alick, my boy,\\r\\n\\n\\nI must say that you brought it all on yourself by your tardiness and\\r\\n\\n\\nseeming indifference.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very sorry if I have seemed to be indifferent, when in fact I was\\r\\n\\n\\nvery far from _really_ being so. I hope my dear cousin will forgive me,”\\r\\n\\n\\nbowed Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, of course she will. She spoke only from petulance—nothing else,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsmiled the old gentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Anna said nothing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt this most unpropitious moment Mr. Richard Hammond was announced and\\r\\n\\n\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XX.\\r\\n\\n\\n                                RIVALRY.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           And he was jealous, tho’ he would not show it,\\r\\n\\n\\n           For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor an instant the rivals glared at each other; and then remembering in\\r\\n\\n\\nwhose presence they stood, they lowered their eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nRichard Hammond shook hands with his uncle and his Cousin Anna and then\\r\\n\\n\\nturned towards Alexander, and the kindness of his heart overcoming all\\r\\n\\n\\nhis jealousy for the moment, he frankly held out his hand, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How do you do, Alick? I hope you are well!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks, quite so,” returned Lyon, stiffly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe general, a frank-hearted old soldier, did not like the reception\\r\\n\\n\\nthat Alick had given Dick. He thought the successful rival, the accepted\\r\\n\\n\\nlover, the promised husband, might well afford to be more generous; and\\r\\n\\n\\nso to make up to Richard for the coldness of Alexander, he turned to the\\r\\n\\n\\nformer and clapping him on the shoulder, exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, my boy! what are you standing there for? Sit down! sit down! and\\r\\n\\n\\nmake yourself at home. Stay and dine with us. We shall be quite a family\\r\\n\\n\\nparty!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick laughed, thanked his uncle and took the offered seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd really soon his presence seemed to be a godsend to the constrained\\r\\n\\n\\nparty. His gay, good-humored manner and conversation soon raised the\\r\\n\\n\\nspirits and warmed the hearts of all the little group. Even Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nhad the grace to come out of his sulks, and to say:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I must congratulate you, Dick, upon your accession to a large fortune.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, Alick. It came in good time, I tell you that. But Lord,\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick, maybe after all this fortune is only so much more steam clapped\\r\\n\\n\\non the engine with which the demon is driving me on the road to ruin!”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Dick, with his usual outspoken truthfulness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope not; I hope not,” said Alick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I _believe_ not,” put in the general. “I am very glad to know that\\r\\n\\n\\nmy nephew Dick has given up all his wild companions, who having spent\\r\\n\\n\\none fortune for him, would be very glad to spend another.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ran away from them, uncle, ran away from them. I hadn’t courage to give\\r\\n\\n\\nthem up, so I gave them ‘leg bail’ and left them all behind in\\r\\n\\n\\nRichmond.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Right my boy! right! whatever may be said of the heroism of braving\\r\\n\\n\\nbodily perils, it is much wiser to run away from moral danger than to\\r\\n\\n\\nface it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick cannot bear to give any one pain. And if he had stayed among his\\r\\n\\n\\nold associates in Richmond, he would have let them ruin him again,\\r\\n\\n\\nrather than he would have hurt their feelings by cutting their\\r\\n\\n\\nacquaintance,” explained Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Exactly. Therefore I say it was wiser to run away, as it will also be\\r\\n\\n\\nwisest to stay away,” said the general. “But here comes the waiter to\\r\\n\\n\\nlay the cloth for dinner.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey all dined together; and afterwards, as there seemed scarcely any\\r\\n\\n\\nway of eluding the engagement, Alick took Anna to the Opera.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt seemed really discourteous, as Alexander had a whole private box to\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself and Anna, that he would not invite Dick to take a seat in it;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut in fact he could not bring himself to do such violence to his own\\r\\n\\n\\nfeelings of rivalry.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick went to the opera, however; and he occupied an orchestra chair in a\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch better position for seeing and hearing than was Alexander’s and\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna’s private box.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when the curtain fell upon the first act, he came around to the box,\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout seeming to think that he was intruding, and gayly and\\r\\n\\n\\ngood-humoredly talked and laughed with his cousins, until the curtain\\r\\n\\n\\nrose upon the second act. And in the intervals of all the succeeding\\r\\n\\n\\nacts he came round to their box. Though there were two vacant seats,\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander never once invited him to take one of them. Anna always did,\\r\\n\\n\\nhowever, and pressed him cordially to sit down. But Dick always gayly\\r\\n\\n\\ndeclined, and merely leaning over the back of one of the unoccupied\\r\\n\\n\\nchairs, talked and laughed until the rising of the curtain warned him to\\r\\n\\n\\nmake his bow and retreat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe performance was a very long one, so that it was some time after\\r\\n\\n\\ntwelve o’clock when Alexander took Anna back to the hotel and gave her\\r\\n\\n\\nup to the charge of her grandfather.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd it was after two o’clock, when, half frozen and half famished, worn\\r\\n\\n\\nout in body and harassed in mind, he reached his home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs on the evening previous the lights from the little drawing-room\\r\\n\\n\\nwindows, gleaming through the wintry woods, cheered him on his approach\\r\\n\\n\\nand warned him that his loving wife was still up and waiting to welcome\\r\\n\\n\\nhim home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd there he found a bright fire, a warm supper and a happy face to\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfort him. As before she forbore to reproach or to question him, and\\r\\n\\n\\nshe received his voluntary explanation without hesitation and without\\r\\n\\n\\ndoubt;—but this explanation, while true to the letter as far as it went,\\r\\n\\n\\nwas false in the spirit—giving her the impression that still “the\\r\\n\\n\\ntroublesome business connected with his father’s will” detained him in\\r\\n\\n\\ntown.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMuch of his conversation now, while being true to the letter, was false\\r\\n\\n\\nin the spirit. But how could this possibly be expected to last?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDay after day Alexander rode in to town. Night after night he came back,\\r\\n\\n\\nnever earlier than one o’clock, sometimes as late as three or four; for\\r\\n\\n\\non these occasions he would have to escort his cousin to a ball where\\r\\n\\n\\nthe festivities were kept up until near daylight. And though Anna being\\r\\n\\n\\nin half mourning refrained from dancing, she seldom retired from the\\r\\n\\n\\nscene until one or two o’clock.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor many days and nights Drusilla bore this state of things with\\r\\n\\n\\nexceeding patience and cheerfulness; always accepting his excuses for\\r\\n\\n\\nleaving her in the morning, and always having the lighted windows, the\\r\\n\\n\\nwarm drawing-room, the bright fire and the hot supper to welcome him at\\r\\n\\n\\nnight. But ah! worship him as she would, she was but a soul encased in\\r\\n\\n\\nflesh and blood, and her health and spirits from loneliness and late\\r\\n\\n\\nhours, long continued, began to suffer. There was another cause, too,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the poor child’s failing strength, which had her husband known it,\\r\\n\\n\\nshould have appealed strongly to his tenderness. But to do him justice\\r\\n\\n\\nin this particular, he did not know it any more than his wife did. She\\r\\n\\n\\nbecame nervous and irritable, and she wondered what could ail her, to\\r\\n\\n\\nmake her so unlike her old self. She tried very hard first to overcome\\r\\n\\n\\nher nervous irritability, then to keep it from annoying him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter he would leave her each day she would begin to occupy herself\\r\\n\\n\\ndiligently, so that her spirits might not droop. She inspected every\\r\\n\\n\\nportion of her house from roof to cellar, and kept all in perfect order.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe did a great deal of needle-work, she read many books, she painted\\r\\n\\n\\nsome pictures, and she perfected herself in some of the most difficult\\r\\n\\n\\npieces of music. So at first she managed to get through her lonely days.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the day’s work was done, and the sky grew dark, and she knew that a\\r\\n\\n\\nlong, lonely night was before her, she would have a bright fire lighted\\r\\n\\n\\nin the drawing-room and an exquisite little supper planned out for her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then, when bed time came, in her kindness of heart she would send\\r\\n\\n\\nher servants to rest, and she would sit alone by the fire, reading and\\r\\n\\n\\nwatching until his return. Sometimes, in the loneliness of the place,\\r\\n\\n\\nand of the hour, the stillness would grow almost awful to her, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nwould feel that she must speak to some human creature, or go mad, and\\r\\n\\n\\nshe would be tempted to go and call Pina up to sit with her. But there\\r\\n\\n\\nagain her compassion came in and saved her servant from being disturbed.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so, rather than inconvenience another, she would sit on alone\\r\\n\\n\\n“through the dead waste and middle of the night,” until she became so\\r\\n\\n\\nnervous as to dread to hear the sound of her own low breathing, or to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee the reflection of her own scared face in the glass.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut then how welcome the sound of his horse’s feet, which her listening\\r\\n\\n\\nears could hear in the deep silence even when he was riding along the\\r\\n\\n\\nopen road before he turned into the wood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen in a moment all was changed. The flush of joy chased the paleness\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom her cheeks; the light of love beamed from her eye; and she was\\r\\n\\n\\nready to welcome him with her happy face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                     THE SORROWS OF THE YOUNG WIFE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n              Yet for all this, let him stand\\r\\n\\n\\n                In my thoughts, untouched by blame,\\r\\n\\n\\n              Could he help it, if my hand\\r\\n\\n\\n                He had claimed, with hasty claim?\\r\\n\\n\\n              That was wrong, perhaps, but then\\r\\n\\n\\n                Such things be, and will again.\\r\\n\\n\\n              Women cannot judge for men.—E. B. BROWNING.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOne morning near the last of February, when the young wife arose,\\r\\n\\n\\nleaving her husband still in bed heavily sleeping off his fatigue, she\\r\\n\\n\\nfound that it was snowing fast, the flakes coming down fine and thick as\\r\\n\\n\\nsifted flour, and promising a deep and heavy fall. And she was glad to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee it, for she said to herself:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Surely Alick cannot leave home on such a tempestuous day as this.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd if it had been possible for her fireside and breakfast table to have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen brighter and more attractive than they always were, she would have\\r\\n\\n\\nmade them so this morning for his sake. And the hope, the almost\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainty of having him home all day long made her face radiant with joy\\r\\n\\n\\nand beauty.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently he came down heavily enough.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What beastly weather!” he said, looking through the window at the\\r\\n\\n\\nthickly falling snow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer face fell a little, she scarcely knew why. But she touched the bell\\r\\n\\n\\nand ordered the breakfast served.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And tell Leo to have my horse at the door in half an hour,” added\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are not going out on such a day as this, dear Alick,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I am. It is that horrid business. Now, Drusilla, my little woman,\\r\\n\\n\\ndo try to be cheerful and don’t vex me by looking that way,” he said, as\\r\\n\\n\\nhe saw her grave face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am only sorry, dear, that you have to leave home in such weather,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat is all,” she answered, as she turned and busied herself with\\r\\n\\n\\npouring out the coffee that was just then set upon the table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he ate his breakfast in haste, dressed in haste and then mounted his\\r\\n\\n\\nhorse and hurried off to town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe snow continued to fall and the day passed very heavily with the poor\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung wife. Still her thought was for her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what a night he will have to come home in,” she said to herself\\r\\n\\n\\nagain and again, as she saw that the weather grew worse and worse as the\\r\\n\\n\\nday waned later and later.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length towards evening she could keep her anxiety to herself no\\r\\n\\n\\nlonger, and she said to her maid:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Pina, what a night for Mr. Lyon to ride home in!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, ma’am, I don’t think he will come at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not come home at all!” echoed Pina’s mistress, aghast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why you see, ma’am, it will be dangerous. Only look out. The fences are\\r\\n\\n\\nnearly all covered and the snow is still falling,” said the girl,\\r\\n\\n\\npointing through the windows of the kitchen where this conversation took\\r\\n\\n\\nplace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I see,” sighed the lonely wife, and her heart seemed to sink like lead\\r\\n\\n\\nin her bosom. But then she took herself to task and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why should I feel so miserable because my husband must stay away from\\r\\n\\n\\nme for one night? I would much rather that he should stay all night in\\r\\n\\n\\nWashington than risk his life in attempting to return home in the\\r\\n\\n\\ndarkness, through such a snow-storm as this, in which all landmarks seem\\r\\n\\n\\nto be lost.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so she tried to reason with her longing heart.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt night, however, it stopped snowing. But the wind came up from the\\r\\n\\n\\nnorthwest and blew very hard, and the new fallen snow began to freeze as\\r\\n\\n\\nfirm as adamant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What do you think now, Pina? Do you think your master can get home?”\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired the master’s wife of her maid.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor, ma’am, why this is worse than the other.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is, Pina?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This freeze is worse than the falling snow, ma’am; because it will make\\r\\n\\n\\nthe roads all as slippery as glass; so, even if his horse is rough shod,\\r\\n\\n\\nmaster will hardly be able to get home.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, Pina, I trust that he will run no risk. But, in case he should\\r\\n\\n\\ncome, we must have everything ready for him as usual. The worse the\\r\\n\\n\\nweather, the more comfort he will want. So you must dress the wild duck\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the roaster, and I will make a little cabinet pudding,” said Pina’s\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress, tying on an apron and tucking up her sleeves.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“We may prepare for him, ma’am, but he will never return such a night as\\r\\n\\n\\nthis, you may take my word for that. It would be as much as his life and\\r\\n\\n\\nlimbs are worth to attempt it,” answered the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThese words made the young wife very uneasy. Much as she wished for his\\r\\n\\n\\npresence, she now prayed that he might not set out to return. And it was\\r\\n\\n\\nwith some comfort she reflected that Alexander never unnecessarily ran\\r\\n\\n\\nany risk; that he would certainly be able to judge of the dangers of the\\r\\n\\n\\nroads, and would as certainly avoid them. Still, in the event of his\\r\\n\\n\\nreturning that night, she was determined to have everything ready for\\r\\n\\n\\nhim.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs night deepened, it grew colder and colder. Outside it was like the\\r\\n\\n\\npolar regions. There\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                 “Dread winter spread his latest glooms\\r\\n\\n\\n                 And reigned tremendous—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n—all darkness, snow and ice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nInside, all was light, warmth and comfort.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the drawing-room a large bright fire was burning; the little table\\r\\n\\n\\nwas laid for supper; the easy chair and the warm slippers were ready.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt ten o’clock, Drusilla, as usual, would have dismissed her maid to\\r\\n\\n\\nbed, but the girl pleaded to remain up “for this once” with her\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, ma’am, master will not be home to-night, I’m certain\\r\\n\\n\\nsure of it. But you’ll sit up all the same. So please let me sit up with\\r\\n\\n\\nyou till you gives it up.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As you like, Pina,” replied the young mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the little lady settled herself in one of the easy chairs before the\\r\\n\\n\\nfire, and the maid nestled down among the foot cushions in the corner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn less than an hour, Pina, overcome with the heat of the fire and the\\r\\n\\n\\nheaviness of her own head, fell fast asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla watched on, almost as much alone as if her maid had been a\\r\\n\\n\\nhundred miles away—as very likely she was, in the spirit.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla was hoping against hope, that her too much loved husband might\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn home and in safety; but she could not justify this hope to her\\r\\n\\n\\nreason, for certainly this was a night in which no man in his senses,\\r\\n\\n\\nwho valued his life and limbs, would take the road; and just as\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainly, Alexander had a wholsome regard for his own; so it was not\\r\\n\\n\\nlikely that he would risk them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStill, Drusilla waited and watched until the clock struck twelve. Then,\\r\\n\\n\\nas her maid was snoring sonorously, to say nothing of baking her head by\\r\\n\\n\\ngetting it almost into the fire, Drusilla woke her up and ordered her\\r\\n\\n\\noff to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina, too utterly wearied with watching, and too stupid with sleep to\\r\\n\\n\\nmake any resistance, stumbled off to her attic, finding her way as a\\r\\n\\n\\nsomnambulist might.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla was left quite alone. The clock struck two. And still she\\r\\n\\n\\nwatched on and on. She thought there was little use in doing so, but she\\r\\n\\n\\ncould not help it. She continued, at intervals, to stare through the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindows, and to listen to every sound without, though she saw nothing\\r\\n\\n\\nbut the darkness of the night, and the glimmer of the snow-clad,\\r\\n\\n\\nspectral looking trees, and heard nothing but the howling of the wind\\r\\n\\n\\nand the rattling of the icicles.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut suddenly, through all deeper sounds, she heard the merry ringing of\\r\\n\\n\\nsleigh-bells!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she started to her feet, for she knew in an instant, that her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband had come home in a sleigh—a possibility that had never occurred\\r\\n\\n\\neither to herself or her servant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe ran to the door and pulled it open. But Alexander had turned around\\r\\n\\n\\nto the stable, and so it was some ten minutes before he returned to the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt flew open at his knock, and Drusilla threw herself in his arms; she\\r\\n\\n\\ncould not help this, she was so overjoyed at his almost unhoped for\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn in safety that night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Up still, my faithful little darling?” he said, kissing her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; and I hope you are very hungry this time, as well as very cold,\\r\\n\\n\\ndear Alick, for I have such a supper for you!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes? Well you may swear that I am famished, for I have not broken my\\r\\n\\n\\nfast since luncheon,” he laughed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe helped him to draw off his overcoat, and hung it up in the hall; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthen she pulled him with affectionate solicitude and playful force out\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom the cold hall into the snug little drawing-room, and made him\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfortable.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear Alick, your hands are almost frozen! You must have had a real\\r\\n\\n\\nLaplander’s ride, and without the Laplander’s furs. How came you to\\r\\n\\n\\nundertake it, dear?” she asked, as she pushed him down in his arm-chair,\\r\\n\\n\\nand sat on a cushion at his side, and took his icy hands between her own\\r\\n\\n\\nwarm ones, and rubbed them. “Why did you come, Alick, dear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My darling, it is bad enough for me to stay away from you as much as I\\r\\n\\n\\ndo—as much as I am _compelled_ to do on account of that vexatious\\r\\n\\n\\nbusiness; but really it would be too bad to stay away all night, and I\\r\\n\\n\\nnever mean to do that,” he answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick dear, how glad I am to hear you say so. And I am so glad you\\r\\n\\n\\ncame to-night, since you have reached home in safety. The servants\\r\\n\\n\\nthought that you would not come, that it would be too dangerous a\\r\\n\\n\\njourney to undertake on horseback.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So it would, my dear, and that is the reason why I bought the sleigh;\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich, besides, I thought would be useful this winter.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, indeed, so it will. And we are both so fond of sleighing. We\\r\\n\\n\\nshall have some fine sleighing together,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe made no reply to the observation, for he knew full well that he\\r\\n\\n\\nshould have no time to realize her anticipations.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t you remember, Alick, the fine sleigh rides we used to have in the\\r\\n\\n\\nChristmas holidays, when you used to come home to spend them; and when\\r\\n\\n\\nyou used to take Miss Anna out, and always insist that your ‘child,’ as\\r\\n\\n\\nyou called me, should go along, too? Do you remember, Alick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, little Drusa, quite well,” he answered gravely, and with some\\r\\n\\n\\nemotion, as he tenderly smoothed her hair with his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, can I ever forget all your kindness to me from that time to the\\r\\n\\n\\nvery present? Can I ever do too much—can I ever do enough for you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor little Drusa!” he murmured.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But there, your hands are warm now, and I will set the supper on the\\r\\n\\n\\ntable,” said the busy little housewife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen Alick was warmed and fed, and comforted and satisfied, he turned\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom the table and the fire towards his little wife, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, Drusa, as I had the sleigh I thought I might as well bring\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething home in it besides myself. So I walked into several of the\\r\\n\\n\\nbook stores and picked up the best of the new books that are published.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“New books! Oh, thank you, dear Alick; where are they?” eagerly\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed Drusilla, rising from her chair to look for them; for she who\\r\\n\\n\\nhad so few amusements—so few?—I should have said no amusements at\\r\\n\\n\\nall,—was delighted at the mention of new books. “Where are they, Alick\\r\\n\\n\\ndear?” she repeated, glancing around the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sit down, my pet. Do you think I could have brought them in my hand, or\\r\\n\\n\\nin my pocket? Why, they are an armful for a railway porter. I left them\\r\\n\\n\\nin the sleigh in the stable. You shall have a glorious time over them\\r\\n\\n\\nto-morrow; it is too late to look at them to-night even if we had them\\r\\n\\n\\nlying before us; for, do you see what o’clock it is?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla glanced up at the Ormolu time-piece on the mantle shelf, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsaw, with surprise, that it was nearly two o’clock in the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Alexander arose at the same moment to put up the guard and close the\\r\\n\\n\\nshutters, saying, with a smile,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“We have to be our own servants when we are so unreasonable as to sit up\\r\\n\\n\\nso late, love.” And soon after both retired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next day was intensely cold, but clear and brilliant; the ground was\\r\\n\\n\\ncovered deep with hard frozen snow, and the trees were clothed with\\r\\n\\n\\nfrost and ice, and the sun shone out of a bright blue sky, lighting up\\r\\n\\n\\nall the scene with blinding radiance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nImmediately after breakfast, Mr. Lyon had the sleigh brought around to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe door. The packages, left in it from the night before, were ordered\\r\\n\\n\\nto be taken out and brought into the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Here, little one! here are some dozens of new books that will help you\\r\\n\\n\\nto kill the time between this and my return,” said Alexander, directing\\r\\n\\n\\nher attention to the packages.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, thank you, Alick. But must you go to town again to-day?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Of course I must; I must go every day for some time yet.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla suppressed the sigh that arose to her lips, but she could not\\r\\n\\n\\nforbear the question:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And stay late, Alick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is as it may be, Drusa. I shall return as soon as I can get away.\\r\\n\\n\\nNow amuse yourself with your books, and don’t mope.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, I won’t mope,” said Drusilla. “You are so good to me, Alick, I\\r\\n\\n\\nought not to do so.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe jumped into his sleigh, and sped away to the ringing of the bells.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she watched him out of sight, and then turned into the drawing-room\\r\\n\\n\\nand sat down among her new books, and began to unwrap them. Most of my\\r\\n\\n\\nreaders know the delight of opening and examining a package of new\\r\\n\\n\\nbooks. Drusilla was absorbed in the pleasure of opening package after\\r\\n\\n\\npackage, and examining volume after volume, until at length she selected\\r\\n\\n\\nthe book that she wished to read first, and laid it aside, and then she\\r\\n\\n\\ntook the others into the library and put them in proper places.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe had scarcely completed this pleasant piece of work, before she heard\\r\\n\\n\\nher maid calling to her:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, ma’am, ma’am, come here, please, and see the snow-birds.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe who loved all living creatures, went into the kitchen and looked\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom the windows, and saw hopping about upon the frozen snow several\\r\\n\\n\\nhundred of these little creatures.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, who had always spent her summers in the country, but her\\r\\n\\n\\nwinters in town, had never seen, or, if she had seen, had never\\r\\n\\n\\nparticularly noticed, these birds before.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My! what a sight! What brings so many of them here, Pina?” she\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired, in astonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, you see, ma’am, the ground and the bushes and the trees are all\\r\\n\\n\\ncovered with frost and snow and ice, and they can’t find anything to eat\\r\\n\\n\\nin the woods or fields or lanes, and so they look for food about\\r\\n\\n\\nhouses.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor little things! What do they eat, Pina?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anything eatable, ma’am, that is small enough for them to\\r\\n\\n\\nswallow;—grains of rice, crumbs of bread, specks of meat——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, throw out whole handfuls of rice for them,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That would hardly do, ma’am. It would sink in the snow and be lost\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore the birds could get it. But if you will let me sprinkle food on\\r\\n\\n\\nall the window-sills around the house, you will see the little creatures\\r\\n\\n\\ncome in scores to eat. And it will amuse you, like, ma’am, to sit and\\r\\n\\n\\nsee the art of the little rogues, how one will watch from a bush to see\\r\\n\\n\\nthe coast clear, and then notify the others to come and eat.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, then,” said Drusilla, with all the eagerness of a child, “crumble\\r\\n\\n\\nup several loaves of bread, and sprinkle every window-sill of the house\\r\\n\\n\\nfull as it will hold.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Would you like some traps set in the woods, ma’am?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Traps, what for?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To catch the birds, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To catch the birds?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am. They make excellent pies, and——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, hush—no!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The boys will catch them, ma’am, if you don’t. They set traps in the\\r\\n\\n\\nwoods. And they puts food under them. And the little birds go to get it,\\r\\n\\n\\nand are caught and killed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How cruel and treacherous! Poor little things, to be frozen out, and\\r\\n\\n\\nstarved out, and to come to us for food and shelter, and to be killed\\r\\n\\n\\nand eaten. The boys shan’t trap them on our place, any way. So if you or\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo find a trap in our woods break it up, and if you find a trapper whip\\r\\n\\n\\nhim!” said the little champion of birds, as she left the kitchen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThat day passed with Drusilla less drearily than usual.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen all her household duties had been discharged, she sat in her snug\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle drawing-room, feasting upon her new books, and furtively watching\\r\\n\\n\\nthe snow-birds that were feasting upon the crumbs on the window-sill,\\r\\n\\n\\nand which as furtively watched her, and flew away the instant they\\r\\n\\n\\ncaught her eyes, only to fly back the instant they saw them fall upon\\r\\n\\n\\nher book again; for these little raiders did not yet know their\\r\\n\\n\\nbenefactress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo quiet was this place that the wild creatures of the woods feared not\\r\\n\\n\\nto approach it; and Drusilla, looking from her window, could see the\\r\\n\\n\\nsquirrel seated on a twig and nibbling his nut, or the opossum curled up\\r\\n\\n\\nin his hole, or the fleet little hare race across the frozen snow, or\\r\\n\\n\\nthe raccoon peeping from the hollow of his tree. It was well that this\\r\\n\\n\\nchild of nature loved nature with all her children so well, for not a\\r\\n\\n\\nhuman being could Drusilla see from her window.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer beautiful wild wood home—beautiful even in the dead of winter—was\\r\\n\\n\\nseparated on all sides by many acres of thick woods from any public\\r\\n\\n\\nthoroughfare. The road leading through the woods was a strictly private\\r\\n\\n\\none leading to her house, and nowhere else.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla sat alternately reading and watching her favorites, until two\\r\\n\\n\\no’clock in the afternoon, when Pina brought in her mistress’s simple\\r\\n\\n\\ndinner of boiled chicken and custard pudding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a solitary dinner; for things had come to such a pass now that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe little wife, instead of taking a luncheon in the middle of the day,\\r\\n\\n\\nand waiting dinner for the husband who never, never came to eat it,\\r\\n\\n\\nalways now dined alone soon after noon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd now Drusilla consoled herself for the absence of her husband by\\r\\n\\n\\nthinking of the supper she would prepare for him and share with him in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Pina,” she said, as she saw the snow-birds fly away from the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow-sill at her slightest motion; “Pina, will I never be able to tame\\r\\n\\n\\nthese little creatures by kindness?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, ma’am; you may make them so tame that they will come and eat\\r\\n\\n\\nout of your hand.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How—how can I do that?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“By just doing as you do now, ma’am. They will soon find out as you mean\\r\\n\\n\\nthem no harm but good, and they will cease to fear you and begin to love\\r\\n\\n\\nyou,” answered the girl, as she removed the dinner service.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla spent the afternoon as she had spent the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThat night Alexander, for a wonder, came home as early as eight o’clock.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the cheerful day was succeeded by a happy evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                       DIFFICULTIES OF DECEPTION.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                Ah, what a tangled web we weave,\\r\\n\\n\\n                When first we venture to deceive.—SCOTT.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander had his troubles too, and they were not the less trying\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause he had brought them on himself by his own wrong-doing—rather the\\r\\n\\n\\nmore so, in fact, since remorse was added to regret, and the loss of\\r\\n\\n\\nself-respect to the loss of domestic peace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was learning by personal experience that “the way of the transgressor\\r\\n\\n\\nis hard.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe found it very difficult to play two parts and live in two places at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe same time.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was the way his day passed. He usually arose at ten o’clock in the\\r\\n\\n\\nmorning, with a bad head-ache and a worse heart-ache, made a quick\\r\\n\\n\\ntoilet and a poor breakfast, then threw himself into the saddle and rode\\r\\n\\n\\naway as fast as his horse’s feet could carry him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe always contrived to be at his rooms in his hotel by eleven o’clock in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe forenoon, lest his uncle should call for him and find him out. And\\r\\n\\n\\nalways on entering his chamber he would tumble his bed and slop his\\r\\n\\n\\nwash-stand to deceive the servants of the hotel into the idea that he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad slept there; for he was in constant dread lest his uncle should\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscover that he passed the night elsewhere.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTo carry on the deception, every day he breakfasted at the hotel table,\\r\\n\\n\\nand he dined with his uncle and cousin. And every evening he accompanied\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna to some place of amusement, where she was always the most admired\\r\\n\\n\\nbeauty in the room, and where he was the most envied man, because it was\\r\\n\\n\\ngenerally understood that he was her betrothed husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe seldom returned home before one o’clock, and sometimes not before\\r\\n\\n\\nthree in the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYou perceive by this how little time he had to bestow on his young wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile Drusilla was more lonely than words can tell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJust think of it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was the depth of winter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe lived in a lone house in a thick wood. She had no companion in the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse, no acquaintance in the neighborhood, and no correspondent in the\\r\\n\\n\\nworld. She never made a visit, or had a visitor, or wrote a letter, or\\r\\n\\n\\nreceived one. Her one object in life was her husband; her one interest\\r\\n\\n\\nin the day his return at night; and if he had given her a little more of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis company, if only an evening now and then, she could have been\\r\\n\\n\\nhappy;—or if, when he did come home, he could have been more cheerful in\\r\\n\\n\\nher presence, she would have been less miserable.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut, ah! friends, Alexander—as is always the case with an evil-doer—went\\r\\n\\n\\non from bad to worse.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when morning after morning he gulped down his coffee in hot haste,\\r\\n\\n\\nand hurried away from his home, in eager anxiety; and when night after\\r\\n\\n\\nnight he returned in the small hours, too cold, tired and harassed to\\r\\n\\n\\nnotice the preparations she had made for his comfort, or to share the\\r\\n\\n\\nsupper she had kept waiting for him, or even to bestow a kiss or a\\r\\n\\n\\nsmile, or a look upon her; when, in fact, he seemed to have become\\r\\n\\n\\nestranged from her; then, indeed, her heart failed, her beauty faded,\\r\\n\\n\\nand she hung her head like a flower drooping in the cold.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe tried very hard to keep up her spirits and preserve her beauty for\\r\\n\\n\\nhis sake and for her own. For more than all earthly things she wished to\\r\\n\\n\\nretain his love. And she remembered how in her childhood, he had scolded\\r\\n\\n\\nher for crying, telling her that it made her ugly, and that he could not\\r\\n\\n\\npossibly love an ugly little girl; and how she had almost suffocated\\r\\n\\n\\nherself then, in her efforts to suppress her sobs, lest she should grow\\r\\n\\n\\nugly and lose his love.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he had been a mere thoughtless youth, teasing a timid child who\\r\\n\\n\\nloved him; now he was or seemed a heartless man, torturing a sensitive\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung woman, who had given her whole life into his hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYet these were not her thoughts of him; she did not blame him even to\\r\\n\\n\\nherself; she was more ingenious in finding excuses for his conduct, than\\r\\n\\n\\neven he would have been. But she was right in trying to be always bright\\r\\n\\n\\nand beautiful, so as to retain his love, since she valued it so\\r\\n\\n\\nhighly—for he _did_ dislike ugly and sorrowful faces.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd at length, when her powers of self-control were exhausted—when\\r\\n\\n\\nloneliness, late hours, fatigue of body and distress of mind had done\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir work upon her heart and frame, and broken down her health and\\r\\n\\n\\nspirits—her pale face, heavy eyes, languid motions and faltering tones\\r\\n\\n\\nirritated him, for they were so many severe, though silent and\\r\\n\\n\\ninvoluntary reproaches to him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As if it were not enough,” he sometimes said to himself, “that for her\\r\\n\\n\\nsake, I have foolishly given up the most beautiful woman of the day, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsacrificed the most brilliant prospects of my life, and worse than all,\\r\\n\\n\\nplaced myself in a false and degrading position, but that now, she must\\r\\n\\n\\nmake me more miserable still, with her moping manners.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut here his faithful conscience always rebuked him for his injustice,\\r\\n\\n\\nand awakened his memory to remind him, that his poor young wife herself,\\r\\n\\n\\nchild as she was, had at the time of his proposal for her hand, set all\\r\\n\\n\\nthese possible regrets before him, and had warned him to pause and\\r\\n\\n\\nreflect, before taking the irrevocable step of making her his wife; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he himself had been strong to overcome her hesitation and stubborn\\r\\n\\n\\nto maintain his own will.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then in a fit of remorse, he would break out upon himself with:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am certainly the most infernal villain that Heaven ever let live!” or\\r\\n\\n\\nwords to the same effect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn these moods he would go and buy something to take home to Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nsome set of jewels, piece of lace, rich shawl, gay dress, or other\\r\\n\\n\\narticle of vanity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut soon he saw that his child bride, who was still wearing her first\\r\\n\\n\\nmourning for her dead mother, valued these things not in themselves, but\\r\\n\\n\\nonly as proofs of his thought for her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd besides, how could jewels and fine clothes console the loving young\\r\\n\\n\\nwife for the lost society of her husband?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Alexander was provoked, that his efforts to please her were so\\r\\n\\n\\nutterly unavailing. He did not reflect that if she had been a vain,\\r\\n\\n\\nselfish woman, and had loved herself more than she loved him, she would\\r\\n\\n\\nhave been happy in his _presents_, and indifferent to his _presence_.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut as she was neither vain, nor selfish, as she loved him rather than\\r\\n\\n\\nherself, she pined amidst all her plenty, because he was almost always\\r\\n\\n\\nabsent from her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis pining became evident in her appearance, notwithstanding all her\\r\\n\\n\\nefforts to conceal it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd sometimes it exasperated him so much that it was with difficulty he\\r\\n\\n\\ncould restrain himself from reproaching her, and thus adding to the sum\\r\\n\\n\\nof his own injustice and her misery.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOften, also, his temper was severely tried in town by what _he_ called\\r\\n\\n\\nthe difficulties of his position, but what any one else might have\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled the hardships of the transgressor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOne day especially, when he rode into the city a little later than\\r\\n\\n\\nusual, he found his uncle at his room waiting for him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where the deuce is it, Alick, that you gallop off to every morning of\\r\\n\\n\\nyour life?” inquired the old gentleman, who had somehow or other got a\\r\\n\\n\\nhint that his nephew rode _into_ Washington every morning, but had no\\r\\n\\n\\nsuspicion that he slept _out_ of the city every night. “Where the deuce\\r\\n\\n\\nis it that you go?” he repeated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick, taken by surprise, hesitated before he could summon the presence\\r\\n\\n\\nof his mind, and reply:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I make a practice of taking a gallop through the morning air for my\\r\\n\\n\\nhealth.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Umph, umph, umph!” growled the old gentleman. “You look more like you\\r\\n\\n\\nmade a practice of sitting over your wine until four or five, or six\\r\\n\\n\\no’clock in the morning, for your illness.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick laughed rather lugubriously, it must be confessed, for he saw that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old gentleman’s suspicions were aroused, although, of course, they\\r\\n\\n\\nmust have been of the vaguest character.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the general, “you have got a busy day before you, Alick,\\r\\n\\n\\nand no time to lose. First, you have to escort Anna to St. John’s\\r\\n\\n\\nChurch, to be present at the wedding of Senor Don Emillio Arayo, the son\\r\\n\\n\\nof the Brazilian Minister, with Mademoiselle Marie de Courcey, niece of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe French Ambassador. All the world is going, and Anna is going with\\r\\n\\n\\nthem, of course.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Satan fly away with the Spanish puppy and the French ninny!” was\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick’s secret thought. But he bowed, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, I shall be most happy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And then you are engaged to dine at Major General Scott’s. And after\\r\\n\\n\\nthat to go and take Anna, to see the great new tragedienne, Mrs. Starrs,\\r\\n\\n\\nin Lady Macbeth; after which you sup with me and Anna.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What a fussy old Polonius uncle is getting to be, to be sure! I really\\r\\n\\n\\nthink the old man is falling into his dotage,” thought Alick within\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself. But he answered aloud:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A very pleasant programme, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Aye, I suppose you young people think it so. I confess I don’t. But,\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick, my boy, I must beg you to forego your gallop to-morrow morning.\\r\\n\\n\\nMy old friend—and your late father’s oldest friend—Commodore Storms, is\\r\\n\\n\\ncoming to breakfast with me at eight o’clock, and, of course, you must\\r\\n\\n\\njoin us. It will be the only chance you will have of seeing him, as he\\r\\n\\n\\nis only passing through the city on his way south, and leaves by the\\r\\n\\n\\nmid-day train to-morrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander stared in dismay, and then inquired:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Could I not see him to-day, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, he is gone with a party to visit Mount Vernon. Besides, what time\\r\\n\\n\\nhave you to do any thing to-day but what is appointed for you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“None indeed,” said Alexander with an involuntary sigh, which did not\\r\\n\\n\\nescape the notice of the old man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Does it afflict you so much then?” enquired the general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The idea of your giving up your mysterious morning ride for a breakfast\\r\\n\\n\\nwith two old Revolutionary relics like the commodore and myself,”\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered the general, fixing a scrutinizing gaze upon his nephew’s face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh no, sir! I—was thinking only how much rather I would see my father’s\\r\\n\\n\\nold friend sooner than later,” answered Alexander, again true in the\\r\\n\\n\\nletter but false in the spirit of his reply.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so Mr. Lyon concluded that there was no alternative for him but to\\r\\n\\n\\nstay in town all night as well as all day. And he did so, fully carrying\\r\\n\\n\\nout the programme sketched for him by his uncle, but feeling all the\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile great pain from the thought that his poor lonely young wife would\\r\\n\\n\\nsit up the whole night waiting anxiously for his return.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next day was quite as much taken up with engagements as any former\\r\\n\\n\\nday had been; and so it was long past midnight when Alick got home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe found Drusilla wan and wasted with waiting and watching there two\\r\\n\\n\\ndays and nights of suspense and anxiety; but he saw no look of reproach\\r\\n\\n\\nin her gentle eyes, heard no word of blame from her sweet lips.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe perceived her sufferings and was angry with himself for causing them,\\r\\n\\n\\nand he began some lame explanation of his absence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she saw his embarrassment and stopped his faltering words with a\\r\\n\\n\\nkiss, and she said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear Alick, it is enough that you are here again to make me happy. You\\r\\n\\n\\ndo not need to render your poor little wife, who has not much wisdom of\\r\\n\\n\\nher own, an account of your actions.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she told him the little news of the two days at home, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed and jested and served his supper with her old cheerfulness and\\r\\n\\n\\nalacrity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next morning Alexander went to town with the deliberate purpose of\\r\\n\\n\\nending his own perplexities and his wife’s sufferings, by doing the\\r\\n\\n\\nright thing and confessing his secret marriage, to his uncle.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut ah! it always happened whenever an especial fit of repentance moved\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander to amendment, something occurred to throw him back upon his\\r\\n\\n\\nevil course and confirm him in it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo it was on this morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe strolled into a reading-room and sat down at one of the tables and\\r\\n\\n\\ntook up a paper to look at the news of the day. He had not been there\\r\\n\\n\\nmore than five minutes when he heard his cousin Anna’s name mentioned in\\r\\n\\n\\nconnection with his own. Impulsively he looked up and listened.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe speakers, seated at a table near, were strangers to him, as he\\r\\n\\n\\nevidently was to them, since they discussed his private affairs so\\r\\n\\n\\nfreely in his hearing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I tell you there is not a word of truth in it. It is all a mistake. It\\r\\n\\n\\nis a false report. The beautiful Anna cares no more for young Lyon than\\r\\n\\n\\nshe does for you or me. If she cares for any one on earth, it is for\\r\\n\\n\\nthat handsome fellow, Dick Hammond, who has just come into a great\\r\\n\\n\\nfortune,” said the first speaker.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That may all be quite true. I am not saying who she cares for, but who\\r\\n\\n\\nshe is going to marry. She may not care a pin for Lyon, and she may\\r\\n\\n\\nadore Hammond; but for all that she must marry Lyon and give Hammond the\\r\\n\\n\\ngoby, since such was the will of the two ancient landed proprietors, her\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandfather and granduncle, who long ago decided that their large\\r\\n\\n\\nestates should be united,” said the second speaker.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, if I were the lady’s choice, Dick Hammond, I think I should set a\\r\\n\\n\\nvery serious impediment between the union of those said estates.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And if I were the betrothed lover, Alexander Lyon, I would break Dick’s\\r\\n\\n\\nneck for his presumption,” said the last speaker, as both arose from the\\r\\n\\n\\ntable and strolled away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander’s anger and jealousy were both aroused, and his good\\r\\n\\n\\nresolutions were put to flight. He arose and followed the two speakers,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut they had disappeared in the crowd.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe days of duelling are past, thank Heaven; else Alexander would have\\r\\n\\n\\nliked to have sought out and called out one or both of these male\\r\\n\\n\\ngossips and exchanged a shot with either or both of them at ten paces.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs it was he could only let his anger cool down and then acknowledge to\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself that they had really neither done nor said anything very wrong.\\r\\n\\n\\nThey had only unconsciously wounded his self-love and aroused his\\r\\n\\n\\njealousy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna Lyon, his beautiful cousin, had always been intended for himself,\\r\\n\\n\\nhe said, and Dick Hammond knew it. And even now, for all Dick Hammond\\r\\n\\n\\nknew to the contrary, he, Alick Lyon, had the exclusive right to Anna’s\\r\\n\\n\\nregards.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHow then did he, Dick Hammond, dare to set himself up as a lover of\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, and a rival of her betrothed?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYes! and how dared Anna, in the face of her parent’s will and her own\\r\\n\\n\\nengagements, receive and favor him as such?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick ground his teeth with rage and jealousy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“They must never know, they _shall_ never know, but that my claims to\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna’s hand are as good as they ever were!—At least they shall not know\\r\\n\\n\\nit until all possibility of Hammond’s union with Anna is destroyed,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Alick to himself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd that day he devoted himself with lover-like assiduity to his Cousin\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna. And that night he remained in town all night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlas, for Drusilla! She had fallen upon still darker days; for now she\\r\\n\\n\\nnever even knew when waiting up for her husband, whether he would return\\r\\n\\n\\nor not.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStill—still she strove against despondency and hoping against hope,\\r\\n\\n\\nassumed some cheerfulness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                             SILENT SORROW.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n          And the little lady grew silent and thin,\\r\\n\\n\\n            Paling and ever paling,\\r\\n\\n\\n          As is the case with a hid chagrin,\\r\\n\\n\\n            And they all said she was ailing.—ROBERT BROWNING.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe young wife’s faith and hope were sinking under the pressure of\\r\\n\\n\\ncoldness and solitude; and only her undying love survived in all its\\r\\n\\n\\nstrength and beauty.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was seriously ill, though she still kept up, moving about the house\\r\\n\\n\\nto attend to her domestic affairs all day, and sitting up to receive her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband half the night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd these exhausting duties of course made her worse.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd oh, illness in woman is very repulsive to most men, and especially\\r\\n\\n\\nto those of Alexander Lyon’s fastidious nature and self-indulgent\\r\\n\\n\\nhabits. Illness pales the cheeks and dims the eyes; and worse than all,\\r\\n\\n\\nit frets the nerves and tries the temper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo it was with Drusilla: weary and anxious, suffering in mind and body,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen Alexander came home near morning she could not always welcome him\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the happy glances he had been accustomed to receive from her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd on these occasions her sad face and tearful eyes so displeased and\\r\\n\\n\\nirritated him, that he would go off to his own room without touching the\\r\\n\\n\\nrefreshments that she had got ready for him, or even stopping to bestow\\r\\n\\n\\na kind word upon her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe meant, by this conduct, to punish her for what, in his thoughts, he\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled “her sulks.” But this sort of punishment nearly broke her loving\\r\\n\\n\\nheart. He caused her depression and then blamed her for being depressed.\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was as if he had crushed a violet and then blamed it for withering.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a pity, too, that just at this time such a contrast should have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen exhibited between his brilliant, beautiful and imperious cousin and\\r\\n\\n\\nhis little, pale, drooping wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe would spend the evening with Anna at some fashionable assembly, where\\r\\n\\n\\nhe saw her, in all the splendor of beauty and pride of place, the\\r\\n\\n\\nall-admired belle of the season, the reigning queen of society;—and\\r\\n\\n\\nthen, full of the intoxication of her new charms, he would return home\\r\\n\\n\\nto find Drusilla, pale, weary and depressed, and he would start off to\\r\\n\\n\\nhis own room to curse the fate that had so long blinded him to the\\r\\n\\n\\ntranscendent attractions of his high-born cousin, and bound him for life\\r\\n\\n\\nto the insignificant daughter of his housekeeper. And the very bitterest\\r\\n\\n\\nelement in his misery was the thought that, sooner or later, his old\\r\\n\\n\\nrival, Richard Hammond, must win the priceless treasure that he himself\\r\\n\\n\\nhad so madly cast away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt is to be feared that if at this time Alexander Lyon could possibly\\r\\n\\n\\nhave devised any means of secretly and legally repudiating his young\\r\\n\\n\\nwife, he would not have hesitated to do so. As it was, he estranged\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself from her, and passed more nights in his rooms at the hotel than\\r\\n\\n\\nin his home at Cedarwood. But he never gave the gentle creature a single\\r\\n\\n\\nharsh word or look; with all his madness—and his mood was little less\\r\\n\\n\\nthan madness—he could not do either; he simply broke her spirit by\\r\\n\\n\\ncoldness, neglect and avoidance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd yet, notwithstanding all this, if he had but known it, in his heart\\r\\n\\n\\nof hearts it was Drusilla he loved and not Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe had made no mistake in marrying this sweet girl; it had been a true\\r\\n\\n\\ninspiration that had drawn him towards her when he was a youth and she a\\r\\n\\n\\nchild. She was the better half of his spirit, and the guardian angel of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis life, as well as the true love of his youth. And once he knew all\\r\\n\\n\\nthis to be true; but now he seemed to have forgotten.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBesides, Drusilla—soul and body, beyond all doubt or question—was his\\r\\n\\n\\nown; and therefore was she undervalued and despised as something of\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle worth; while Anna was unattainable by him, and likely to become\\r\\n\\n\\nthe wife of his rival; and therefore was Anna over-rated as a pearl\\r\\n\\n\\nbeyond price, and desired with passionate eagerness. But whatever this\\r\\n\\n\\nphrenzy was, for the girl whom he had known from his boyhood up, and in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis thoughts rejected as a wife years before—it was not love; it was\\r\\n\\n\\nprobably a hallucination made up of pride, jealousy, admiration, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nfascination of the unattainable. Alexander Lyon had fancied many a\\r\\n\\n\\nbeauty in his life; but he had never once loved any other than the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung, devoted wife whom he now so insanely wronged and grieved.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd ah! how severely she suffered in secret, how bitterly she wept over\\r\\n\\n\\nthe ever-increasing estrangement; never blaming him, however, even in\\r\\n\\n\\nher thoughts; blaming herself, rather, for not being able to merit his\\r\\n\\n\\nlove and make him happy; never losing faith in him, but losing faith in\\r\\n\\n\\nherself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer love was without a taint of selfishness; but it was not without sin,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor it was idolatrous.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe seemed to herself to have no life but in him. Failing as she\\r\\n\\n\\nthought, to _merit_ his love, and failing to make him happy, she was\\r\\n\\n\\nwilling to die to set him free and give him peace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor Alick,” she said, in her heart, as she paced up and down her\\r\\n\\n\\nforsaken chamber floor, wringing her hands and weeping bitterly; “Poor\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick, it is not his fault that we are both so miserable, it is mine. I\\r\\n\\n\\nam not a fit wife for him; I never was; but I loved him so! I loved him\\r\\n\\n\\nso. Ah, but if I had loved him rightly I never would have let him\\r\\n\\n\\nshipwreck his life upon me—so unfit to be his mate. He married me out of\\r\\n\\n\\npity, and I let him do it, and now I deserve to be wretched. But he is\\r\\n\\n\\nwretched too, though he don’t deserve to be so. Ah! what can I do to\\r\\n\\n\\nundo all this?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in the climax of her hysterical passion she was almost ready to lay\\r\\n\\n\\ndown her young life that her beloved might step over it into liberty and\\r\\n\\n\\nlight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, why, oh, why did he ever ruin his hopes by wedding me? Why? Oh, I\\r\\n\\n\\nknow too well why. Poor Alick! it was out of the goodness of his heart\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he did it! He was always so good to me from my infancy up, calling\\r\\n\\n\\nme his child, giving me everything I needed, doing all I asked. And when\\r\\n\\n\\nhe saw me a poor little motherless and homeless girl, he took pity on\\r\\n\\n\\nme, and raised me up and put me on his bosom and comforted me and tried\\r\\n\\n\\nto love me; but he cannot, because I am not lovable; and now, even now,\\r\\n\\n\\nhe never gives me an unkind word or look, only stays away from me\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause he cannot love me, and he is too honest to feign a love he\\r\\n\\n\\ncannot feel. Oh, Alick! I would die to make you free and happy again, if\\r\\n\\n\\nit were not a sin! I would, dear, I would!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSuch was the burden of her lamentations in her hours of secret\\r\\n\\n\\nsuffering.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNo word of these sad plaints reached his ears. Her paroxysms of anguish\\r\\n\\n\\nwould have exhausted themselves, or she would have obtained some degree\\r\\n\\n\\nof self-command before his late return home; so that though pale and\\r\\n\\n\\nsad, and bearing the traces of recent tears, she met him with composure;\\r\\n\\n\\nfor she remembered, poor child, his abhorrence of an ugly, weeping face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut now he had no mercy on her; she seemed to him a fetter that galled\\r\\n\\n\\nhim, and he pitied himself and not her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSometimes, when she looked even more than usually pale and ill, he\\r\\n\\n\\nwondered whether she was going to die; but he wondered without alarm,\\r\\n\\n\\nand even without pity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla spent the long winter evenings in reading. She read a great\\r\\n\\n\\nnumber of books, but they were not always the most judiciously chosen,\\r\\n\\n\\nor the best calculated to cheer her spirits or strengthen her mind.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAmong the new works that Alexander brought home one night and threw\\r\\n\\n\\ncarelessly upon the table, was Mrs. Crowe’s “Night Side of Nature.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd this book subsequently fell into Drusilla’s hands, and she seized\\r\\n\\n\\nand read it with avidity. And worse than all, she read it in her lonely\\r\\n\\n\\nnight watches in that isolated country house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe work, written with great power to prove the reality of the\\r\\n\\n\\nre-appearance of departed spirits in this world, and filled with\\r\\n\\n\\naccredited stories of apparitions, haunted houses, marvellous visions,\\r\\n\\n\\npresentiments, omens, warnings, dreams, et cetera, had a great\\r\\n\\n\\nfascination for Drusilla, and night after night she pored over its dark\\r\\n\\n\\npages with a morbid fervor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was another book that came in her way about the same time, and\\r\\n\\n\\nexercised the same fatal spell over her impressible imagination. It was\\r\\n\\n\\nthat volume of De Quincy’s works containing the “Three Memorable\\r\\n\\n\\nMurders,” and worked up with all the fearful intensity of the Opium\\r\\n\\n\\nEater.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe effect of these books upon her excitable nervous system was\\r\\n\\n\\nterrible.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was owing very much to the circumstances under which they were\\r\\n\\n\\nread. In a solitary house, in a deep wood, in the dead of night, and in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe depth of winter. And often, her imagination would be so wrought\\r\\n\\n\\nupon, that she would not dare to lift her eyes to the looking-glass over\\r\\n\\n\\nthe mantle-piece, lest she should meet there the reflection of some face\\r\\n\\n\\nother than her own, nor venture to glance at the windows on her left,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor fear she should see some spectral form peering in through the\\r\\n\\n\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so, in the appalling solitude and silence of the scene, and of the\\r\\n\\n\\nhour, imaginary terrors were added to real troubles, and between them\\r\\n\\n\\nboth her nervous system was nearly broken down.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt is true that she might have ameliorated her condition in more than\\r\\n\\n\\none way, but that she had too much consideration for others and too\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle for herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe might have gone to bed early each night but that Alexander had no\\r\\n\\n\\nnight key, and there was no one to let him in whenever he pleased to\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn, except herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlso, she might have made Pina sit up to keep her company; but she would\\r\\n\\n\\nnot deprive the girl of rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLastly, she could at least have closed the window shutters against that\\r\\n\\n\\nimaginary spectral form she always feared to see; but she chose to leave\\r\\n\\n\\nthem open that the light from her drawing-room might cheer her beloved\\r\\n\\n\\nin his late approach to the house—whenever he chose to come home; which\\r\\n\\n\\nwas not often at this period.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut this state of things could not last forever; and a crisis was at\\r\\n\\n\\nhand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOne dark, still, winter night, when not a star was to be seen in the\\r\\n\\n\\nsky, and the very air, as well as the earth and the water seemed\\r\\n\\n\\nfrozen—between two and three o’clock after midnight, Drusilla sat alone\\r\\n\\n\\nin her drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTo while away the tedious hours she had read until her eyes filmed and\\r\\n\\n\\nher brain reeled. And then she had been compelled to lay aside her book,\\r\\n\\n\\nand sink back in her resting chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the excited state of her nervous system she could not sleep, for she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas listening through the dead stillness of deep night, hoping to hear\\r\\n\\n\\nthe sound of the horse’s feet, that was always the warning of her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband’s approach.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd yet she had no means of knowing whether he would return that night\\r\\n\\n\\nor not.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs she sat there waiting and listening, she could but remember the\\r\\n\\n\\npossible dangers of her position.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe house contained much of the sort of property that tempt\\r\\n\\n\\nburglars—property at once very valuable and very portable—such as silver\\r\\n\\n\\nand gold plate, jewels and money.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe had been living in it now some months, and secludedly as she lived,\\r\\n\\n\\nher abode there, and the richness and defencelessness of the premises\\r\\n\\n\\nmight well have come to the knowledge of the professional burglars,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhose acuteness in discovering such rich mines of unprotected treasure\\r\\n\\n\\nis much finer than that of the detectives who are always supposed to be\\r\\n\\n\\non their track.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHow easy—how perfectly easy it would be, she thought, for even one\\r\\n\\n\\nresolute villain to break through those unprotected glass windows, and\\r\\n\\n\\nmurder her, and rob the house, in safety and at leisure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe cottage was half a mile from any other dwelling house, and a quarter\\r\\n\\n\\nof a mile from any public road. The wildest shriek that might ever rise\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom dying victim in its rooms, could never be heard by human ears\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs Drusilla remembered these circumstances her very soul grew sick with\\r\\n\\n\\nterror. And was it any wonder?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was a young, delicate, impressible woman. And on this dark night,\\r\\n\\n\\nand in this isolated house she was quite alone. Her man-servant was in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis loft over the stables, where he slept, with pistols by his side, to\\r\\n\\n\\nguard the valuable horses. And her maid-servant was in her attic over\\r\\n\\n\\nthe kitchen, in a distant part of the dwelling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAny determined thief could easily have entered the house and worked his\\r\\n\\n\\nwill upon the poor young neglected wife and the property.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh Alick, dear Alick, if you could know how much I suffer, you would\\r\\n\\n\\nnot leave me so,” she groaned, wringing her hands and rising in her\\r\\n\\n\\nrestlessness to walk the floor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut almost immediately her worshipping heart rebuked her for having cast\\r\\n\\n\\neven a shadow of reproach upon her husband, and she hastened to add,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But it is my own fault. He has done everything for my comfort here;\\r\\n\\n\\ngiven me a beautiful home, and attentive servants. And I ought to be\\r\\n\\n\\nhappy and courageous. Instead of that, I am sad and timid, and\\r\\n\\n\\naltogether unworthy to be called his wife. I do not wonder that he\\r\\n\\n\\nwearies of me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo weeping and wringing her hands she paced up and down the floor, until\\r\\n\\n\\nin turning around she faced the front, unclosed windows, and suddenly\\r\\n\\n\\nuttered a piercing shriek and fell upon her face in a deadly swoon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd well she might. For peering in at the window, from the darkness\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout was a livid white face—a man’s stern face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                           THE SPECTRAL FACE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           I felt my senses slackened with the fright\\r\\n\\n\\n           And a cold sweat shrilled down, o’er all my limbs,\\r\\n\\n\\n           As if I’d been dissolving into water.—DRYDEN.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n               And now the morning sky resumes her light,\\r\\n\\n\\n               And nature stands recovered of her night,\\r\\n\\n\\n               My fear, the last of ills, remains behind,\\r\\n\\n\\n               And horror heavy sick upon my mind.—IBID.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen Drusilla recovered from her deathly swoon, the cold gray light of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe winter morning was stealing through the unshuttered windows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe lifted herself upon her elbow and gazed around her in utter\\r\\n\\n\\nbewilderment. Slowly, slowly came memory back to her. And with it the\\r\\n\\n\\nsense of fear and the instinct of flight. But before she could command\\r\\n\\n\\nher chilled and benumbed limbs, observation and reflection both assured\\r\\n\\n\\nher that there was now no cause for alarm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe windows were still closed although the shutters were open.\\r\\n\\n\\nEverything in the room was in its usual place. Nothing had been\\r\\n\\n\\ndisturbed. No intruder had been there. Whose ever the face had been that\\r\\n\\n\\nhad looked in upon her through the window in the dead of night, it had\\r\\n\\n\\ndone no harm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe feeling of relief with which Drusilla acknowledged all this was\\r\\n\\n\\nspeedily followed by one of extreme depression; for by all the signs\\r\\n\\n\\naround her, she perceived that Alexander had not yet come home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe lamps were still burning brightly in the face of the broadening day.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the untasted supper sat in its covered dishes on the hearth. But the\\r\\n\\n\\nfire had burned out and the room was cold.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nVery drearily Drusilla arose; put out the lamps and then went up to her\\r\\n\\n\\nown chamber, and rang the bell for her servant, to make her a fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good patience, ma’am!” exclaimed the girl when she entered the chamber\\r\\n\\n\\nand found the bed undisturbed, and her mistress in the dress of the\\r\\n\\n\\nevening before. “Surely ma’am, you have never been sitting up all\\r\\n\\n\\nnight?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have not been in bed, as you see, Pina. Make me a fire as quickly as\\r\\n\\n\\nyou can, for I am very cold. And then bring me some warm water and get\\r\\n\\n\\nme a cup of tea,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen all these orders had been obeyed, and the unhappy young wife had\\r\\n\\n\\nrefreshed herself with a wash, a change of dress and a cup of hyson, and\\r\\n\\n\\nreclined at rest in her easy chair, she said to her handmaid:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Pina—go and bring your brother here, I wish to question him in your\\r\\n\\n\\npresence.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl started at this unusual order, and looked alarmed, as if she\\r\\n\\n\\nsupposed that herself and her brother were to be arraigned upon some\\r\\n\\n\\ngrave charge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut her mistress perceived her fears and hastened to relieve them by\\r\\n\\n\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t be afraid, Pina; there is nobody in fault that I know of. I only\\r\\n\\n\\nwish to question your brother upon a circumstance that occurred last\\r\\n\\n\\nnight. Now go at once and fetch him here.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl left the room and went to find her fellow servant, who was in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe kitchen eating his breakfast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You must just leave off gormandizing this minute and come up to _her_\\r\\n\\n\\ndirectly. Something’s up; but I don’t know what it is. She says she\\r\\n\\n\\nwants to question you about what happened last night, whatever that was,\\r\\n\\n\\nif you know, for I don’t. I hope you’ve not been having unproper\\r\\n\\n\\ncompany, and misbehaving of yourself up there in the stable loft,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nPina, breathlessly, as she stood before her brother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo, with his mouth full and his eyes starting, stared at his sister in\\r\\n\\n\\nstupefaction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, I say; come along with me up to the mistress,” repeated Pina.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What for? I haven’t been a doing of nothing!” exclaimed the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, tell her so, then, and get her to believe it; but come along.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo reluctantly left his tea and muffins and bacon, and hesitatingly\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowed Pina to the presence of his mistress, where he also expected to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe arraigned upon some charge of misconduct.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the first worst words of the little lady set him at ease.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo, have you seen any suspicious persons or any strangers lurking\\r\\n\\n\\nabout here lately?” she inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor, no ma’am, no person at all, not a soul, except ’twas master and\\r\\n\\n\\nyou, ma’am, and Pina and me. The place is so out of the way, you know,\\r\\n\\n\\nma’am. And so lonesome! Awful lonesome I calls it,” answered the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No sportsmen after birds or other such small game?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not a one, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nor boys setting traps for snow-birds?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, ma’am. Bless you, ma’am, hasn’t I just told you how I’ve never seen\\r\\n\\n\\na human face about the place, except it is you and master’s and me and\\r\\n\\n\\nPina’s.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, _I_ saw a man’s face between two and three o’clock after\\r\\n\\n\\nmidnight, peeping in at the drawing-room windows,” said the little lady\\r\\n\\n\\nvery gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, ma’am!—whose could it a been?” inquired the boy in\\r\\n\\n\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is what I do not know, and what I wished to ascertain.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe boy scratched his head and looked confounded.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A face a peeping in at the windows in the dead o’ night! Bless us and\\r\\n\\n\\nsave us!” he muttered to himself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall be feared to stay in the house nights when the master’s not\\r\\n\\n\\nin,” said Pina, turning as pale as one of her color could.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope there is nothing to fear. I shall speak to your master as soon\\r\\n\\n\\nas he comes home,” said Drusilla, to reassure her domestics.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But there’s so many bugglers about,” said Pina, with a shudder.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And to be sure, the house is very unprotected like and lonesome, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthere’s a deal of silver and gold into it,” added Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think the face was that of a burglar. If it had been, he might\\r\\n\\n\\nhave entered the house and killed me, and taken what he wanted. There\\r\\n\\n\\nwas nothing to prevent him,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah-h-h!” screamed Pina, “I shall never dare to sleep in the house when\\r\\n\\n\\nmaster is away.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall ask your master to allow Leo to sleep in the house when he\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself means to be absent,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But then they would steal the horses,” objected Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, and if they do? Ain’t the mistress’s life, to say nothing of the\\r\\n\\n\\ngold and silver plate, and money and jewels, a deal more vallearble than\\r\\n\\n\\nthe hosses, you——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina stopped her tongue in time not to call her brother bad names in her\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress’s presence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You may both go now. And, Pina, say nothing of what has happened. And\\r\\n\\n\\nyou, Leo, keep your faculties on the alert and try to discover this\\r\\n\\n\\nmystery,” said the little lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What—what is it I am to do with my factories, ma’am?” inquired the boy,\\r\\n\\n\\ndoubtingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are to keep your eyes and ears open and try to find out who it was\\r\\n\\n\\nthat looked into my window,” said Drusilla, smiling even in the midst of\\r\\n\\n\\nher sadness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, ma’am,” answered the boy, as he bowed himself out, followed by\\r\\n\\n\\nhis sister.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThat day, owing to the alarm of the previous night and the long swoon,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the awakening in the cold room, Drusilla was unusually ill, both in\\r\\n\\n\\nmind and body; she remained in her chamber, wrapped in her dressing gown\\r\\n\\n\\nand reclining in her easy chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut when evening came, from sheer force of habit, she roused herself and\\r\\n\\n\\ngave orders for a fire to be kindled and lamps to be lighted in the\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing-room, and supper to be prepared in case her husband should\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she dressed herself with care and went down and seated herself in\\r\\n\\n\\nher usual place to be ready to receive him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut another long and lonely evening was before her, with an unusual\\r\\n\\n\\ntrial at its close.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt ten o’clock, as usual, Pina came in to ask her mistress if there were\\r\\n\\n\\nany more orders and to bid her good night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Pina, I want nothing more this evening. You may go,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Won’t you let me close the shutters, ma’am, for fear that gashly face\\r\\n\\n\\nwill look in again?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Pina, they must be left open to guide your master home. The night\\r\\n\\n\\nis very dark, and here are no gas-lighted streets, you know,” smiled the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle lady, determined not to yield to her fears.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, ma’am,” said the girl, hesitatingly—“Brother Leo, ma’am, he says\\r\\n\\n\\nif you would take the ’sponsibility to give him an order so to do, he\\r\\n\\n\\nwould stay in the house until master comes home. Shall I tell him to do\\r\\n\\n\\nit, ma’am?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Certainly not. Leo must not disobey his master; nor can I interfere\\r\\n\\n\\nwith Mr. Lyon’s arrangements,” answered the faithful wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina looked distressed; and raising and rolling her apron and casting\\r\\n\\n\\ndown her eyes, she ventured to say:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beg pardon, ma’am, but won’t you please be coaxed to let Brother Leo\\r\\n\\n\\nstay in the house to take care of us instead of the horses to-night?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“By no means, Pina. Say no more about it, my good girl,” answered the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle matron, firmly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl looked up at her mistress to see if she was really in earnest,\\r\\n\\n\\nand then burst into tears and sobbed forth the broken words:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, ma’am, if you won’t let Brother Leo stay in here to take care of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house an’ us, plea—plea—please let me go long of him to the stable;\\r\\n\\n\\nbecau—cau—cause I should die of fright to stay here with nobody but you,\\r\\n\\n\\nma’am, please.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla looked at the maid in surprise and displeasure for a minute,\\r\\n\\n\\nand then her beautiful benevolence got the ascendancy over every other\\r\\n\\n\\nemotion, and she answered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You poor, timid girl, go if you wish.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you won’t be ang—ang—angry long of me, ma’am, I hope?” inquired\\r\\n\\n\\nPina, half ashamed of herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No more than I should be angry with a hare for running away. It is your\\r\\n\\n\\nnature, as it is the hare’s, to be cowardly.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, ma’am, as Brother Leo is a waiting to know what he is to\\r\\n\\n\\ndo, I may go now, mayn’t I?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, go.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good night, ma’am, please; and I hope the Lord will take care of you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do not doubt that He will, Pina. Good night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so the girl retired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla was left quite alone, not only in the room but in the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse. At first she felt very desolate and depressed and inclined to\\r\\n\\n\\ncry. But presently she reasoned with herself:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That timid girl was really no protection. I am quite as safe without\\r\\n\\n\\nher as with her. I must trust in the Lord without whom ‘the watchman\\r\\n\\n\\nwatcheth in vain.’ One of our wisest sages said, to become heroic, we\\r\\n\\n\\nmust be sure to do that which we most fear to do. And I suppose his\\r\\n\\n\\nwords must be received in their spirit rather than in the letter. I fear\\r\\n\\n\\nto jump into the fire, and I will not do so. And I fear, oh, how I fear,\\r\\n\\n\\nto stay in this house alone to-night! And all the more because I fear to\\r\\n\\n\\ndo it, I _will_ do it, rather than break up my husband’s arrangements by\\r\\n\\n\\ncalling Leo from the stables to guard me, and rather than torture that\\r\\n\\n\\npoor cowardly girl by making her stay here to keep me company. But I\\r\\n\\n\\nwill not touch De Quincey’s or Mrs. Crowe’s works to-night to add to my\\r\\n\\n\\nmorbid terrors. I will read the book of comfort.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so saying, Drusilla took the Bible from its stand, and opened at the\\r\\n\\n\\nPsalms of David, those inspired outpourings of the soul, that have\\r\\n\\n\\nconsoled and strengthened—how many millions of suffering and fainting\\r\\n\\n\\nhearts, for how many thousand years!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWe must now leave Drusilla to meet the events of the night, and we must\\r\\n\\n\\nturn to Alexander, and relate the circumstances that had kept him away\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom his home these three days past—circumstances more ominous of evil\\r\\n\\n\\nto his gentle wife than anything which had as yet happened at Cedarwood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                                CAUGHT.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n       There’s danger in that dazzling eye,\\r\\n\\n\\n         That woos thee with its witching smile;\\r\\n\\n\\n       Another when thou art not by,\\r\\n\\n\\n         Those beaming looks would fain beguile.—FRANCES OSGOOD.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was the short session of Congress, which would close on the fourth\\r\\n\\n\\nof March. The fashionable season, therefore, was nearly over, and it was\\r\\n\\n\\nending in true carnival style.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere were morning concerts, theatricals, receptions, etc., all day; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthere were evening concerts, theatricals, receptions, dinners, balls and\\r\\n\\n\\nparties all night. And “everybody who was anybody” was expected to\\r\\n\\n\\n“show” at all.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe belle of the season went everywhere; and often appeared at half a\\r\\n\\n\\ndozen different scenes of festivity or revelry in one night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer constant escort, Alexander Lyon, had no sinecure. He went with her\\r\\n\\n\\neverywhere; partly because his uncle willed that he should go with her,\\r\\n\\n\\nand he could not well refuse without explaining his reasons for doing\\r\\n\\n\\nso, and he could not explain, without acknowledging his secret marriage\\r\\n\\n\\nwith Drusilla; partly because he imagined himself in love with his\\r\\n\\n\\nbrilliant cousin; but mostly because he determined that Richard Hammond\\r\\n\\n\\nshould not supplant him in his office of escort.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor two days during which he had not appeared at his home, he had been\\r\\n\\n\\non a “perpetual” round of pleasure with Anna. The first day he attended\\r\\n\\n\\nher to a breakfast given at the Executive Mansion; to a _matinèe\\r\\n\\n\\nmusicale_ at the French minister’s; to an afternoon debate in the Senate\\r\\n\\n\\nChamber; to a dinner party at General Stott’s; and to the theatre to see\\r\\n\\n\\na celebrated comedienne; and, lastly, to a supper at General Lyon’s\\r\\n\\n\\nroom; all this in one day and evening; so, of course, he could not get\\r\\n\\n\\nhome that night. The next day he went with her, first to a wedding at\\r\\n\\n\\nSt. John’s church, and to the wedding-breakfast at the house of the\\r\\n\\n\\nbride’s mother; then to hear part of a very interesting case at the\\r\\n\\n\\nSupreme Court; next to the reception of a cabinet minister; then to an\\r\\n\\n\\nexhibition of paintings; from that to a dinner party at the Brazilian\\r\\n\\n\\nminister’s; and, finally, to the very grandest hall of the carnival,\\r\\n\\n\\ngiven by the wife of a millionaire, who had taken a furnished house for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe season, and reserved herself for this final magnificent affair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was considered a great distinction to get an invitation to this ball.\\r\\n\\n\\nOnly the “elite” were invited, and all the “elite” were there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, restricted by her mourning to a certain style of dress was still,\\r\\n\\n\\nas always, the most beautiful and the most admired woman of the\\r\\n\\n\\nassembly. And Alexander was proud of her as his reputed betrothed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn all the success of the season Anna had never had such a dazzling\\r\\n\\n\\ntriumph as upon this evening. She seemed to turn all heads with her\\r\\n\\n\\nbewitching beauty, until at length her own brain seem dizzied with her\\r\\n\\n\\nconquests. She grew capricious and exasperating. Alexander hovered\\r\\n\\n\\naround her; and he would not have left her for a moment that evening if\\r\\n\\n\\nshe had not, with a furtive and angry flash of her blazing blue eyes,\\r\\n\\n\\nperemptorily ordered him to leave her. And to complete his mortification\\r\\n\\n\\nand despair, she beckoned Richard Hammond to come to her, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nretained him in her suite for the rest of the evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander was half maddened by this conduct of his cousin. His blood\\r\\n\\n\\nboiled when he saw her smiling upon his rival; and when he saw that\\r\\n\\n\\nrival basking in those smiles; and he would have liked to have throttled\\r\\n\\n\\nRichard then and there; but he knew that it would never do to make a\\r\\n\\n\\nscene in that place; so he stood scowling and muttering curses, and\\r\\n\\n\\nplanning vengeance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon, who for once had been tempted to come out in the evening\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the sake of being present at this great ball, and meeting many of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis old friends whom he knew would be there, saw the provoking behavior\\r\\n\\n\\nof the young pair and resolved that as soon as he should have them at\\r\\n\\n\\nhome he would favor the coquette and the rival with a good sound\\r\\n\\n\\nreprimanding lecture. But the festivities were kept up all night; and so\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old soldier, who broke down at about one o’clock, was forced to\\r\\n\\n\\nretire and leave the beauty and her rival lovers to their own devices.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNot, however, without whispering to each of the delinquents in turn:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall want to see you at my rooms to-morrow at twelve noon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was broad daylight when the ball broke up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna was at length under the necessity of giving Richard his congee, and\\r\\n\\n\\nresigning herself to the charge of Alexander, who, having escorted her\\r\\n\\n\\nto the ball, was of course obliged to take her home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn reaching her lodgings, Anna went to bed to sleep off her fatigue. And\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, who had hardly spoken during the drive home, hurried off to\\r\\n\\n\\nhis rooms at the Blank House, to procure what rest he could before the\\r\\n\\n\\nhour at which he was to wait upon his uncle.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt twelve o’clock precisely, the old soldier, having breakfasted, was\\r\\n\\n\\nseated in his private parlor waiting for his fractious young people.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna was the first to come in. And her grandfather was just clearing his\\r\\n\\n\\nthroat to begin upon her when the door was opened and Mr. Richard\\r\\n\\n\\nHammond was announced.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! very well, it is just as easy to speak to you both at the same\\r\\n\\n\\ntime,” said the old gentleman, turning around in his chair and facing\\r\\n\\n\\nthe culprits.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd very imposing looked the veteran as he sat there with his majestic\\r\\n\\n\\nperson, grave countenance and silver hair and beard.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the young cousins were certainly awed by the dignity of his aspect\\r\\n\\n\\nas well as abashed by a sense of their own follies.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come and stand before me, sir and madam.” (This gentleman of the old\\r\\n\\n\\nschool, always on ceremonious occasions, addressed ladies, whether\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried or single, by the title of “madam,” which in its true meaning is\\r\\n\\n\\nsimply _ma dame_, or my lady, and applies with equal propriety to maids\\r\\n\\n\\nor matrons.)\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir and madam, come and stand before me,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the young people, with the reverence they had been educated to show\\r\\n\\n\\nto age, approached and stood before the old man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTheir ready obedience mollified him to a certain extent; for when he\\r\\n\\n\\nspoke again it was in a milder manner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My daughter and my nephew,” he said, “your conduct lately, and\\r\\n\\n\\nespecially your deportment last evening, has shamed and grieved me. It\\r\\n\\n\\nmight be said of our ancient house, as it has been said of another noble\\r\\n\\n\\nline, that all the men were brave and all the women pure. Let me not see\\r\\n\\n\\nin you two the first exceptions to that proud rule.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe cheeks of the young lady and the brow of the young gentleman flushed\\r\\n\\n\\ncrimson with mortification; but neither spoke, and the old gentleman\\r\\n\\n\\ncontinued:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No brave man ever tries to supplant an accepted suitor. And no pure\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman ever encourages the rival of her betrothed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe flush deepened on the cheeks of Anna and on the brow of Richard, and\\r\\n\\n\\nboth cast down their eyes, but neither opened their lips.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And,” proceeded the veteran hero, “I should blush for the daughter of\\r\\n\\n\\nmy house who should prove a coquette, as I should blush for the son who\\r\\n\\n\\nshould prove a coward. My children, I hope I have said enough. Be brave\\r\\n\\n\\nas all the men of our line, and pure as all its women.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Richard,” said Anna, with eyes flashing through their tears, “Cousin\\r\\n\\n\\nRichard, you must bid me farewell here, now, and forever.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe took the hand she extended to him, and holding it within his own,\\r\\n\\n\\nturned to his uncle and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, you _have_ said enough, and so has my cousin. What it costs me to\\r\\n\\n\\nleave her, only heaven knows. But you have made an appeal that cannot be\\r\\n\\n\\nresisted, and I bow before it. Farewell, sir! And Anna, my cousin,\\r\\n\\n\\ngood-bye! Good-bye! God bless you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd after wringing Anna’s hand, he dropped it, bowed to his uncle, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhastened away to conceal the tears that rushed to his eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna threw herself down upon the sofa, buried her head in its pillows,\\r\\n\\n\\nand sobbed convulsively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old man, with his hands clasped behind his back, and his\\r\\n\\n\\nsilver-haired head bowed upon his bosom, walked slowly up and down the\\r\\n\\n\\nfloor. At length, he came to his sobbing daughter, and laying his hand\\r\\n\\n\\ntenderly upon her head, said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am sorry, Anna. I am sorry, my child. I would I could bear all pain\\r\\n\\n\\nin your stead. But, Anna, I cannot bear this pang for you. And you know\\r\\n\\n\\nthat faith must be kept, though hearts be grieved—aye, or——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore he could finish his sentence, the door was opened, and Mr. Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nwas announced.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn seeing Alexander enter, Anna started up from the sofa, and hurried\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good morning, sir. I hope I have not disturbed my cousin?” said Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon, bowing, and shaking hands with his uncle.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sit down, Alick,” said the old man, without replying to his\\r\\n\\n\\nobservation. “I wish to speak to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander seated himself, and looked attentive.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick, I saw how much annoyed you were last night by Richard’s marked\\r\\n\\n\\nattentions to Anna, and her seeming encouragement of them.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Seeming,’ sir! It was more than seeming; and much more than mere\\r\\n\\n\\n‘encouragement.’ Sir, she solicited those attentions,” said Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith scarcely suppressed indignation, and entirely forgetting that _he_\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainly had no right to object to all this.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tut, tut, tut, tut, boy, that is very strong language. However, I can\\r\\n\\n\\noverlook it, as the provocation was very great. But, Alick, it was only\\r\\n\\n\\nthe mischievous spirit of a spoiled beauty on her part, and the vanity\\r\\n\\n\\nof a coxcomb on his. I have had them both up before me this morning, and\\r\\n\\n\\nspoken some words to them that they will not readily forget. Anna has\\r\\n\\n\\ndismissed Richard once for all. And he has bid us good-bye, and is gone\\r\\n\\n\\nfor good.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander looked up in surprise and pleasure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it is so,” said the general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Excuse me, sir, was that the reason why my cousin was so very much\\r\\n\\n\\novercome, and ran from the room as soon as I came in?” questioned\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, his jealous doubts again awakening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Um-m, well, you see I had said some pretty severe words to her and made\\r\\n\\n\\nher cry. But it is well she is gone, as I have something to say to you\\r\\n\\n\\nin private.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes sir?” said Alexander, hesitatingly and with a guilty twinge, for\\r\\n\\n\\nhis conscience immediately awakened his fears. What was it his uncle\\r\\n\\n\\nwanted to say to him? Had the old man got an inkling of the cottage at\\r\\n\\n\\nCedarwood and its inmates? Scarcely likely he thought, but still he felt\\r\\n\\n\\nuneasy until the general said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alexander my boy, it is now nearly five months since the lamented death\\r\\n\\n\\nof your dear mother, my esteemed sister-in-law. And I do not for my\\r\\n\\n\\npart, see why your marriage with Anna should be longer deferred. Long\\r\\n\\n\\nengagements are very injudicious indeed; and your engagement has been an\\r\\n\\n\\nexceedingly prolonged one. And I think now that it should terminate in\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage. Come, what do you say?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander turned hot and cold; attempted to speak and failed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old gentleman ascribed all his emotion to excess of love, surprise\\r\\n\\n\\nand joy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, my boy, I really mean it,” he said, smiling. “To defer the affair\\r\\n\\n\\nlonger would not be so much of a respectful tribute to the memory of\\r\\n\\n\\nyour dear mother, as a superstitious observance. Come! find your tongue,\\r\\n\\n\\nman! find your tongue!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The question must be referred to my beautiful betrothed sir. It will be\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her to decide it,” said Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, aye, certainly, to be sure; it will be for her to decide it; but it\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be for _you_ to induce her to decide it in your favor, my lad,”\\r\\n\\n\\nchuckled the old gentleman. “And as you are to take her to see Saviola’s\\r\\n\\n\\nnew picture to-day, you will have a fine opportunity of doing so,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nadded.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt that moment the door was again opened, and Commodore Staughton was\\r\\n\\n\\nannounced.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd as the old naval hero entered the room, Alexander arose and bowed\\r\\n\\n\\nand made his escape.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Mr. Lyon did not attend his cousin to the picture gallery that\\r\\n\\n\\nafternoon. Anna pleaded excessive fatigue, and with good reason, and\\r\\n\\n\\nkept her room until evening, when she went, attended by Alexander, to a\\r\\n\\n\\nreception at the Executive Mansion, that was the last and greatest of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe season.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                           A MEMORABLE NIGHT.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n               ’Tis only the obscure is terrible;\\r\\n\\n\\n               Imagination frames events unknown,\\r\\n\\n\\n               In wild fantastic shapes of hideous ruin,\\r\\n\\n\\n               And what it fears, creates.—HANNAH MORE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was two hours after midnight, on a keen March morning, when Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon, in the face of a fierce northwest wind, rode on towards his almost\\r\\n\\n\\nforsaken home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis frame of mind was not enviable.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNever since he had entered upon his life of deception had his\\r\\n\\n\\ndouble-dealing so much disturbed him. The discovery of his duplicity was\\r\\n\\n\\nnow impending. His uncle had proposed his immediate marriage with his\\r\\n\\n\\nbetrothed; and should the obstinate old gentleman persist in pushing on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe project, and should Anna raise no objection to it, there would be no\\r\\n\\n\\nother course for Alexander to pursue but frankly to confess his secret\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage with Drusilla, and so brave the old soldier’s roused wrath, and\\r\\n\\n\\nbear the young beauty’s bitter scorn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYet, still Mr. Lyon resolved to delay the degradation of such a\\r\\n\\n\\ndisclosure, and the shame of such a scene as long as possible, for still\\r\\n\\n\\nhe hoped, “out of this nettle danger to pluck the flower safety.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was possible, he thought, that his uncle might not persevere in his\\r\\n\\n\\npurpose, and it was probable that Anna herself would be the first to\\r\\n\\n\\nobject to a precipitated wedding, and would insist that the programme\\r\\n\\n\\nshould be followed, and that the full year of mourning for his mother\\r\\n\\n\\nshould elapse before Alexander should claim her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere yet remained nearly eight months to the end of this probation. In\\r\\n\\n\\nthis time, how much, he reflected, might happen to deliver him from his\\r\\n\\n\\ndisagreeable dilemma.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n_Drusilla might die._\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe felt a pang of shame and sorrow as this idea entered his mind. Yet\\r\\n\\n\\nstill he entertained it. Drusilla was now declining in health, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nmight die. And in such a case he should be free from the trammels of his\\r\\n\\n\\nreckless marriage, and from the necessity of making the humiliating\\r\\n\\n\\nconfession that he had ever worn them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAgitated by these evil thoughts, he rode rapidly onward towards\\r\\n\\n\\nCedarwood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he entered the private road leading through the dark wood he saw the\\r\\n\\n\\nbeacon lights of his home in the drawing-room windows, shining out to\\r\\n\\n\\nguide him on his way.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She is waiting for me, poor child,” he said, half in compassion, half\\r\\n\\n\\nin contempt. “Still waiting and watching as she has been doing no doubt,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the last three nights—the last three nights! Ah! and how many nights\\r\\n\\n\\nbehind them! Poor little miserable! I wish I had never seen her!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo muttering to himself Alexander rode around to the stable and put up\\r\\n\\n\\nhis horse, and then walked back to the house and knocked at the front\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt did not fly open as usual at his summons, so he knocked again, louder\\r\\n\\n\\nthan before; but there was no response.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he sounded an alarm upon the knocker, and waited for the result.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut when the noise he made died away, all remained silent in the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What the deuce is the meaning of this, I should like to know?” he\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired of himself, as he went down the steps and climbed up to the\\r\\n\\n\\nsill of the front windows, and looked into the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe room was brilliantly lighted up, but the fire in the grate had\\r\\n\\n\\nburned low; the untasted supper covered up on the hearth had probably\\r\\n\\n\\ngrown cold; and the little guardian angel of the place was no where to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe seen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where the mischief can she be?” he asked himself; and having frequently\\r\\n\\n\\nexpressed annoyance that she should sit up late to let him in, he now\\r\\n\\n\\nfelt vexation that she should have gone to rest, and left him to get in\\r\\n\\n\\nas he could.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was nothing now for him to do but to go back to the stable and\\r\\n\\n\\nrouse up his man-servant, and get the key of the kitchen door, by which\\r\\n\\n\\nthat functionary always let himself in in the morning to make the fires.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo slept in the loft over the carriage-room, which was shut off from\\r\\n\\n\\nthe horse stalls, and locked within.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd it required considerable knocking and calling before the man could\\r\\n\\n\\nbe awakened.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen at last he aroused he started up in terror shouting;\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who’s there? Thieves! murder! fire!—go away, or I’ll shoot!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Coward, and fool!—come down and open the door!” loudly and angrily\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed his master.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut before Mr. Lyon had fairly got the words out of his mouth Leo put\\r\\n\\n\\nhis pistol out of the window, and pulled the trigger and blazed away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe ball whizzed past within an inch of the ear of Alexander, who\\r\\n\\n\\ninstinctively dodged and shrank out of the range of fire, as he shouted:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stop that, you villain! What do you mean, you poltroon? It is I, your\\r\\n\\n\\nmaster.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the man was mad with terror; and even while his master spoke, fired\\r\\n\\n\\nagain and again, until he had discharged six shots from his revolver;\\r\\n\\n\\nand then he retired from the window.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, you scoundrel!” again shouted Mr. Lyon, as soon as silence was\\r\\n\\n\\nrestored. “Do you hear me—do you know me now? I am your master. Come\\r\\n\\n\\ndown and open the door; I want you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA minute passed, and then the voice of Leo was heard from above, calling\\r\\n\\n\\ncautiously:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Marse Alick, Marse Alick! Is it you, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Of course it is I, you cursed idiot! who else should it be? And it is\\r\\n\\n\\nvery well for you that I am living to answer, and you are not a\\r\\n\\n\\nmurderer. Come down instantly, I say, and open the door.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor, Leo, chile, it is marster; I knows his speech. So let him in,”\\r\\n\\n\\nspoke another low voice, which Mr. Lyon, in astonishment, recognized as\\r\\n\\n\\nbelonging to Pina.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnother minute passed, and then Leo came down, with his teeth chattering\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom cold and fright, and opened the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, you villain! what have you got to say for yourself, that I\\r\\n\\n\\nshall not have you committed to jail to-morrow on charge of assault with\\r\\n\\n\\nintent to kill?” angrily demanded Mr. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Marse Alick! I’m as much mortified at the mistake as ever I can be.\\r\\n\\n\\nIndeed, sir, I thought it was horse thieves, and I was duty bounden to\\r\\n\\n\\n’fend the hosses, you know, sir,” pleaded Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Umph; well, you must be more careful another time, my man. Your mistake\\r\\n\\n\\nmight have cost you your neck, you know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“’Deed, sir, I—if I had been so misfortunate as to hurt you I shouldn’t\\r\\n\\n\\na cared _that_ for my neck! I should a wanted to a’ hanged myself ’dout\\r\\n\\n\\nwaitin’ for the judge to do it,” said the boy, so earnestly that he at\\r\\n\\n\\nonce disarmed his master.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very well, I dare say you speak truly. And now let me have the key of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe back door; I wish to get in the house and go to bed. Your mistress\\r\\n\\n\\nhas shut up the place and retired. I suppose she has given up all\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughts of seeing me to-night. Where is the key?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Here it is, sir; shall I go on to the house with you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, there is no need. Oh, by the way—was not that Pina’s voice I heard\\r\\n\\n\\nspeaking to you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And pray how comes she to be sleeping down here in the stable loft,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen she should be in the house with her mistress? And now I think of\\r\\n\\n\\nit, how _is_ your mistress?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, purty much the same as usual, sir,” said Leo, trying to evade the\\r\\n\\n\\n‘previous question.’\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am glad to hear it. But about Pina; how comes she to be sleeping\\r\\n\\n\\nhere?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, you see there’s been a ’larm at the house; and Pina, she was\\r\\n\\n\\nfeared—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘An alarm at the house?’ What sort of an alarm?” anxiously inquired Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, if you will please to let me walk along home with you I\\r\\n\\n\\ncould tell you as I go along.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come then and be quick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh lor, Brother Leo, ask master to wait for me, please. I don’t dare to\\r\\n\\n\\nstay here all alone by myself!” exclaimed Pina, scuttling down from the\\r\\n\\n\\nloft as fast as she could come.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hurry then, you provoking fool; and mind, I have an account to settle\\r\\n\\n\\nwith you when you come,” said Mr. Lyon, as he stamped his feet and\\r\\n\\n\\nclapped his hands to keep his almost congealed blood in circulation,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile the fierce wind whirled his riding-coat round and round.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeantime Leo quickly took down his own overcoat from its peg in the\\r\\n\\n\\ncoach-room, and put it on.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now then! How dared you to leave your mistress and come down here to\\r\\n\\n\\nsleep, eh?” angrily demanded Mr. Lyon, as Pina came to the side of her\\r\\n\\n\\nbrother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please, sir, it was along of the fright. And mistress said I might. And\\r\\n\\n\\nno more wasn’t she angry long o’ me for it,” whimpered the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Your kind mistress is never angry with anybody for anything,” answered\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon, doing justice to his neglected young wife, on this occasion at\\r\\n\\n\\nleast. “And,” he added, “I will hear what she has to say about the\\r\\n\\n\\nmatter before I excuse you. And now, Leo,” he inquired, turning to the\\r\\n\\n\\nboy, “what about this alarm at the house? I hope it was a false one. Was\\r\\n\\n\\nit of thieves?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, I don’t rightly know whether it was a false alarm or not,\\r\\n\\n\\nnor likewise whether it was thieves.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tell me all you know of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, I don’t know anything about it personably myself. It was\\r\\n\\n\\nnot me as seen the face at the window, in the dead hour of the night, it\\r\\n\\n\\nwas my mistress.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘A face at the window in the dead of night?’” echoed Mr. Lyon, in\\r\\n\\n\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What night?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Last night, sir, about this hour, as I understand.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Give me the particulars.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo began and related the story, as he had received it from his\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is most extraordinary and it must be investigated,” said Mr. Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\nin a musing and anxious manner, as the boy finished the tale. “But,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nadded, turning sternly to the two servants, “how came you, you cowardly\\r\\n\\n\\nbrutes, to leave your young mistress alone in the house to-night after\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch an alarm? I feel inclined to part with you both.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, sir,” said Leo, “I begged my mistress to allow me to stay in the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse to keep guard, I did, indeed, sir; but she wouldn’t so much as\\r\\n\\n\\nhear of it. She said how she wouldn’t interfere long of your\\r\\n\\n\\narrangements, sir; and so she ordered me to go back to the stables and\\r\\n\\n\\ntake care o’ the hosses.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And indeed, master, indeed, sir,” put in Pina, “I did say to my\\r\\n\\n\\nmist’ess wasn’t her safety of more ’count than the dumb brutes; but she\\r\\n\\n\\nwouldn’t hear to me, no more’r to Brother Leo.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And so she sent you both out of the house!” exclaimed Mr. Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\nfrowning darkly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed she did, sir,” answered Pina.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And remained in it alone?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” replied Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Humph!” growled Mr. Lyon, and his anger was diverted from his offending\\r\\n\\n\\nservants to his neglected wife. An insane suspicion took possession of\\r\\n\\n\\nhim, and he mentally connected the mysterious face at the window, with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe circumstance of Drusilla’s sending her servants from the house, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhe drew an inference which nothing but the madness of jealousy could\\r\\n\\n\\nhave inspired, and he hurried on at a pace which even his agile young\\r\\n\\n\\nservants found it hard to keep up with.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey went around to the back door and opened it, and Mr. Lyon, calling\\r\\n\\n\\nhis servants to follow him through the house, groped his way along the\\r\\n\\n\\ndark back passages to the octagon hall and up the stairs to his wife’s\\r\\n\\n\\nchamber, which was dimly lighted by a night-taper on the mantle-piece\\r\\n\\n\\nand a smouldering fire in the grate. The room was vacant and evidently\\r\\n\\n\\nhad not been occupied since the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where can she be?” he inquired, and in an accession of anxiety he\\r\\n\\n\\nhurried through the other rooms of the upper story; but found them all\\r\\n\\n\\nempty.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen, still attended by his servants, he went below stairs and searched\\r\\n\\n\\nthe library and the bird room. But neither Drusilla nor any one else\\r\\n\\n\\ncould be found.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I looked into the drawing-room before I entered the house—looked in\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough the unshuttered front windows and I saw that no one was in\\r\\n\\n\\nthere. But I will look again,” muttered Mr. Lyon, in extreme\\r\\n\\n\\nastonishment and anxiety, as he passed into the apartment in question.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was still brilliantly lighted up and he could see into every corner\\r\\n\\n\\nof it; but he saw, besides the usual furniture, only the neatly spread\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle supper table; the untasted supper covered up on the hearth; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe easy chair and slippers near the blackened fire that had quite gone\\r\\n\\n\\nout.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut his wife was nowhere to be seen in the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This is most inexplicable!” he exclaimed, in consternation, as he\\r\\n\\n\\nturned and looked at his servants, who stood near him aghast with\\r\\n\\n\\nterror. “At what hour did your mistress dismiss you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“At ten o’clock, sir; but we didn’t go out of the house till nearly\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf-past, as it took us some little time to rake out the kitchen fire\\r\\n\\n\\nand fasten up the place,” answered Leo, while Pina fell to sobbing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stop that noise, will you, and follow me. I will search the rooms over\\r\\n\\n\\nthe kitchen; though I suppose it will be quite in vain,” said Mr. Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\ngrimly, as there entered his mind the cruel suspicion that his neglected\\r\\n\\n\\nand lonely young wife had actually left her home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey searched first the kitchen, pantry and laundry, on the first floor\\r\\n\\n\\nof the back building. Then they went up and searched the servants’ rooms\\r\\n\\n\\non the second floor. But without success.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She is gone,” said Mr. Lyon to himself, as he led the way back to the\\r\\n\\n\\ndrawing-room. And in the strangely blended emotions of astonishment and\\r\\n\\n\\nmortification, there was also a delusive feeling of satisfaction and\\r\\n\\n\\nhope. If she was gone, he should be free. Her departure was his\\r\\n\\n\\ndeliverance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he re-entered the drawing-room, still attended by his servants, he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaw the broad morning light streaming in at the front windows. He\\r\\n\\n\\nordered Leo to take away the lamps and to clear out the grate and kindle\\r\\n\\n\\na new fire. And he directed Pina to remove the supper service and\\r\\n\\n\\nprepare his breakfast; for, under all the circumstances, he felt too\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch excited to think of lying down to sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe walked up and down the room, while his servants quickly executed his\\r\\n\\n\\norders. And soon every vestige of the evening’s untasted repast and\\r\\n\\n\\nextinguished fire was removed. And the clean hearth and glowing grate\\r\\n\\n\\ninvited Alexander to repose himself in his easy chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter a while Pina appeared with the table linen in her hand, and\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired, respectfully:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir, will you have the breakfast laid here, or in the\\r\\n\\n\\ndining-room?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In the dining-room, of course,” answered Mr. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The dining-room,” as the reader knows, was but a cozy, elegant, little\\r\\n\\n\\nrecess, curtained off from the drawing-room, and only large enough to\\r\\n\\n\\nhold a small table and two chairs, for the young couple’s tête-à-tête\\r\\n\\n\\ndinners.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs Pina now drew aside the crimson curtain, she uttered a wild scream,\\r\\n\\n\\nand stood transfixed and gazing down upon some object near her feet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander sprang up to see what had frightened her; but as he put aside\\r\\n\\n\\nthe curtain, and saw what was under it, he started back with an\\r\\n\\n\\nirrepressible cry of horror.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\n\\n                           A GREAT DISCOVERY.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             Oh, fatal opportunity!\\r\\n\\n\\n   That work’st our thoughts into desires, desires\\r\\n\\n\\n   To resolutions; and these being ripe and ready,\\r\\n\\n\\n   Then giv’st them birth and brings’t them forth to action.—DENHAM.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n         The means that fortune yields must be embraced\\r\\n\\n\\n         And not neglected; else if fortune would,\\r\\n\\n\\n         And we will not, her offers we refuse,\\r\\n\\n\\n         And miss the means of action and success.—SHAKSPEARE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe whom they had sought so vainly, lay there, doubled up, on the floor,\\r\\n\\n\\nand partly covered by the dropping folds of the curtain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, master! Oh, sir! She is dead! She is murdered! She is, indeed, sir,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the thieves have been in and done it!” cried Pina, recovering her\\r\\n\\n\\nvoice and wringing her hands in grief and terror.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd her dreadful words seemed to be true.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon could not speak. He silently lifted the lifeless form, and\\r\\n\\n\\nshuddering to see how helplessly the head and limbs fell over his arms,\\r\\n\\n\\nhe bore it into the drawing-room, and laid it on the sofa.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina followed him, and stood sobbing and wringing her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe knelt down by the body and gazed on the marble face, the half-open\\r\\n\\n\\neyes, and the rigid lips drawn tightly from the white and glistening\\r\\n\\n\\nteeth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe hastily unfastened the front of her dress, and put his hand in her\\r\\n\\n\\nbosom to feel if her heart yet beat. It seemed still.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe put his ear down to listen if her lungs yet moved. They were\\r\\n\\n\\nmotionless.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe felt her hands and feet. They were cold and stiff.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he arose and stood gazing upon the body.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, is she dead? Is you sure?” inquired Pina, with tears streaming down\\r\\n\\n\\nher face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes. She seems to have been dead some hours;” groaned Alexander, with\\r\\n\\n\\nhis own face as white as that of the lifeless form before him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, master! Oh, sir! The thieves broke in and done it, didn’t they?\\r\\n\\n\\nDidn’t they?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Mr. Lyon, speaking slowly and softly. “There is no\\r\\n\\n\\nevidence of the late presence of thieves in the house. Nothing as yet is\\r\\n\\n\\nmissing. And there is no sign of blood upon her clothing.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, master, but her dress is black, and wouldn’t show it plain.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander knew this to be true, and he also knew that some wounds bleed\\r\\n\\n\\nonly inwardly. So he began to examine her body. First he unloosed her\\r\\n\\n\\nbeautiful hair, and ran his fingers through its tresses, and felt all\\r\\n\\n\\nover her head. But apparently she had received no sort of injury there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile he was proceeding with this inspection, Pina suddenly started up\\r\\n\\n\\nand ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe made a most careful examination, but found no mark of violence upon\\r\\n\\n\\nher person.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd yet he thought she must have come to her death suddenly and\\r\\n\\n\\nviolently; since she had been alive and in her usual health between ten\\r\\n\\n\\nand eleven o’clock on the preceding evening, and now was dead, and\\r\\n\\n\\napparently had been so for several hours.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe had scarcely finished his examination, when Pina rushed back into the\\r\\n\\n\\nroom, holding a fragment of looking-glass in her hand, and exclaiming\\r\\n\\n\\neagerly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Try this! Oh, dear master, try this! Lay it to her lips and hold it\\r\\n\\n\\nthere a minute or so, and if there’s any moisture on it, it is a sign\\r\\n\\n\\nthat there’s a little life left, and where there’s life, you know, if\\r\\n\\n\\nthere’s ever so little, there’s hope.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon silently took the piece of glass, and laid it flat with the\\r\\n\\n\\nbright side to the cold lips, and stood watching the result.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, sir, I’m glad I happened to think of it! I know’d a woman, I did,\\r\\n\\n\\nwho fell down into a fit, and lay for dead all day long; for her breath\\r\\n\\n\\nhad stopped, and her heart had stopped, and she was cold and stiff; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthey were going to lay her out, when somebody said ‘try a glass,’ and so\\r\\n\\n\\nthey tried it, and sure enough, after they held it over her lips a\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle while, there was a moisture on it, and so they knew she still\\r\\n\\n\\nbreathed ever so little, though they couldn’t perceive it in any other\\r\\n\\n\\nway but by the glass—and so—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush, stop,” said Mr. Lyon, interrupting the garrulous girl, and\\r\\n\\n\\nexamining the glass.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was a dimness on its bright surface.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are right. Life is not yet quite extinct. She still breathes\\r\\n\\n\\nslightly.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, sir, I’m so glad! I feel as glad as if—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hurry and make a fire in her bed-chamber, while I carry her up stairs,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Mr. Lyon, again interrupting the stream of the girl’s talk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina flew down stairs to get kindling wood, and to startle her brother\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the news that their mistress had been found in a fainting fit so\\r\\n\\n\\ndeep that she seemed dead, or dying, at the last gasp, and it was\\r\\n\\n\\ndoubtful whether she would ever come out of it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Alexander lifted the insensible form and carried it up\\r\\n\\n\\nstairs, to the bed-chamber, and laid it on the bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina soon came in with the kindling wood and rapidly revived the fire\\r\\n\\n\\nthat had not yet gone out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen, while her master ran down stairs and searched for restoratives,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe undressed her mistress and put her between soft, warm blankets, in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe bed, and began to rub her hands and feet in the hope of restoring\\r\\n\\n\\nthe arrested circulation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon returned with brandy and ammonia, and then master and maid used\\r\\n\\n\\nthe most vigorous means for recovering the unconscious sufferer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor nearly two hours they worked over her; but their efforts seemed\\r\\n\\n\\nutterly unavailing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length when they were almost ready to give over in despair, Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nperceived a slight fluttering near the heart of his wife. With revived\\r\\n\\n\\nhope, he redoubled his efforts and soon had the satisfaction of seeing\\r\\n\\n\\nfurther signs of returning life. Her chest labored and heaved; her lips\\r\\n\\n\\ntrembled and parted; and then she gasped and opened her eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusa, Drusa, my darling, do you know me?” he inquired, looking\\r\\n\\n\\nanxiously in her face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she only gazed at him, with wide open, soft inexpressive eyes,\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout replying.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe hastily mixed a little ammonia and water and raised her head and put\\r\\n\\n\\nthe cordial to her lips. She drank it mechanically; but it immediately\\r\\n\\n\\nrevived her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusa, my little Drusa, do you know me now?” he inquired, setting the\\r\\n\\n\\nglass aside and bending over her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked at him with infinite love, put her arms up around his neck,\\r\\n\\n\\ndrew his head down to hers and kissed him tenderly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe returned her soft caresses, for while he gazed on her sweet, patient,\\r\\n\\n\\nloving face, and reflected that she was just rescued, as it were, from\\r\\n\\n\\nthe jaws of death, he felt all his compassion, if not his affection for\\r\\n\\n\\nher, revived.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What caused your swoon, my little Drusa?” he inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut a spasm of pain, or fear, passed over her face and form, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nshuddered and closed her eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beg your pardon, sir, but if I was you, I wouldn’t ask no questions\\r\\n\\n\\nyet,” said Pina in a low respectful voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are right again,” he answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he contented himself with sitting by his wife’s bed and holding her\\r\\n\\n\\nhand, and occasionally bending down and kissing her forehead.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please sir, to let me go down and bring my mistress up a cup of\\r\\n\\n\\nstrong tea and a bit of dry toast, I think if she could be got to take\\r\\n\\n\\nit, it would do her good,” said Pina.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Go then,” replied Mr. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd as the girl left the room, he stooped and whispered to his wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope you are better, love.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” she answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will not try your strength with questions, now; but as soon as you\\r\\n\\n\\nare able, you will tell me what caused your deep swoon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe drew his head down to hers and answered in a low, faint voice:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_It was the face at the window._”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The face at the window! again last night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe nodded; and her lips grew so white and her eyes so wild with terror,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he hastened to soothe her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There, there is no danger now, my little Drusa! I am here by your side.\\r\\n\\n\\nCompose yourself for the present, and when you have quite recovered you\\r\\n\\n\\nshall tell me all about it, and the affair shall be investigated.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe laid his hand upon her brow; and she with a sigh of relief, closed\\r\\n\\n\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently Pina came in with a little tray upon which stood a cup of tea\\r\\n\\n\\nand a small piece of dried toast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt Alexander’s entreaty and with his assistance, Drusilla sat up and\\r\\n\\n\\ndrank the tea and ate the toast, and then sank back upon her pillow and\\r\\n\\n\\nafter a while, with her hand in his, fell into a natural and refreshing\\r\\n\\n\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander still watched her for five or ten minutes longer, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nafter glancing up at the time-piece on the mantle shelf and seeing that\\r\\n\\n\\nit was nearly eleven o’clock he slipped his hand from hers, told Pina to\\r\\n\\n\\ntake his place by the bedside, and then left the chamber.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe went down stairs into the drawing-room and rang the bell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo answered it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Serve my breakfast immediately and then go and saddle my horse and\\r\\n\\n\\nbring him around to the door,” were Mr. Lyon’s directions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo, much wondering that his master should leave his mistress at such a\\r\\n\\n\\ntime, went out of the room to obey his orders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBreakfast was soon served. Alexander dispatched it in haste, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nwent up stairs to change his dress for his ride into town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen he found himself alone in his dressing-room, all the embarrassments\\r\\n\\n\\nof his false position—forgotten during the exciting events that had\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowed his late arrival at home—were now recalled to mind.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn an hour or two he should meet his uncle and his cousin. The former\\r\\n\\n\\nwould expect that he should make his proposal for immediate marriage\\r\\n\\n\\nwith Anna, and the latter would be ready to meet it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe might either make the anticipated proposal or omit to do it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIf he should make it, and his cousin should meet it favorably, the\\r\\n\\n\\nembarrassments of his position would be multiplied a thousand fold, for\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainly he could not marry two wives; neither could he, after having\\r\\n\\n\\ncommitted himself by his proposal, confess his prior marriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIf he should omit to make the proposal at all, such omission would\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject him to suspicion and severe cross-examination by his uncle and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe grandfather of his betrothed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis first hope, then, was in being able to evade the dilemma by\\r\\n\\n\\nprocrastination; and his second hope was that Anna herself might take\\r\\n\\n\\nthe responsibility of insisting upon a further delay of the wedding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs for his secret marriage with Drusilla, he was now resolved, come what\\r\\n\\n\\nmight, that he would never reveal it; because he felt sure, if he should\\r\\n\\n\\ndo so, that his uncle and cousin would both discard him, and she would\\r\\n\\n\\nbecome the wife of his rival.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut even in the midst of these evil thoughts, he started as an\\r\\n\\n\\nabsent-minded walker might at seeing himself on the brink of a dreadful\\r\\n\\n\\nprecipice,—yes, started with a sudden consciousness of what a villain he\\r\\n\\n\\nwas growing to be—he who up to this time had been a man of stainless\\r\\n\\n\\nhonor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile agitated by these emotions, he was mechanically dressing himself.\\r\\n\\n\\nHe went to his wardrobe to search for a thick coat, for the morning was\\r\\n\\n\\nstill bitterly cold, and the overcoat that he had worn on the previous\\r\\n\\n\\nday and night had received some damage from Leo’s frantic pistol shots.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe took down coat after coat, but they were all too thin.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length, far back in the wardrobe, he found one that he had not worn\\r\\n\\n\\nfor many months. It belonged to the travelling suit that he had worn\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen he went to Alexandria to meet Drusilla and went to the parson to\\r\\n\\n\\nmarry her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith feelings of sadness, regret and compunction, he turned the garment\\r\\n\\n\\nabout and looked at it. Then he carefully brushed it and put it on,\\r\\n\\n\\nbuttoned it closely, and thrust both hands in his pockets to push them\\r\\n\\n\\ndown. In doing so, he felt a folded paper. And in listless curiosity he\\r\\n\\n\\ntook it out, opened it, and looked at it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn an instant all his listlessness vanished. He held it from him, and\\r\\n\\n\\ngazed, and gazed at it with his eyes dilating, his lips parting, and his\\r\\n\\n\\nface blanching with what would have seemed at first view to be amazement\\r\\n\\n\\nand horror, but which soon proved to be delight and triumph.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses. He suspected that\\r\\n\\n\\nhe was dreaming. He pinched himself to prove that he was awake.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he suddenly dropped into a chair, waved the paper above his head,\\r\\n\\n\\nand burst into a loud laugh.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well,” he said, “if I had been the most consummate schemer that ever\\r\\n\\n\\nlived, I could not have plotted for myself better than fortune has\\r\\n\\n\\nplanned for me. Now, then, Mr. Richard Hammond! Let us see now what are\\r\\n\\n\\nyour prospects of ultimately winning the beauty and the heiress! But\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle Drusa! poor little Drusa! patient, loving little Drusa! Thank\\r\\n\\n\\nfortune that you neither know nor suspect anything of this matter! And\\r\\n\\n\\nyou _must_ neither know nor suspect it yet awhile! For the knowledge, or\\r\\n\\n\\neven the very suspicion of this, would go near to kill you. Very, very\\r\\n\\n\\ngradually must you be prepared for it, my darling; very, very gently\\r\\n\\n\\nmust the truth be broken to you, my poor little girl!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe felt now no embarrassment as to his relations, present or\\r\\n\\n\\nprospective, with his betrothed and her grandfather. He was ready to\\r\\n\\n\\npropose to Anna the next day, and to marry her in a month after, if\\r\\n\\n\\nexpedient.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor the paper that he had found in the pocket of his wedding coat, and\\r\\n\\n\\nnow held in his hand, proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that his\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage with poor Drusilla was informal, null and void; that it had\\r\\n\\n\\nalways been so, and that he was legally free to love and to wed\\r\\n\\n\\nwhomsoever he should please.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                               HIS LOVE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           His is the love that only lives,\\r\\n\\n\\n             While the cheek is fresh and red;\\r\\n\\n\\n           His is the love that only thrives,\\r\\n\\n\\n             Where the pleasure feast is spread.—ELIZA COOK.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlthough that little paper furnished a proof that Alexander Lyon was as\\r\\n\\n\\nfree from marriage-bonds as he wished to be, yet it would have been\\r\\n\\n\\nbetter for his own purpose for him to have burned it at once.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut with that strange unwillingness which some people feel to destroy\\r\\n\\n\\neven a dangerous document, he carefully folded it up and put it into his\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle looking-glass drawer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he went into the next chamber and spoke to Pina, who was still\\r\\n\\n\\nwatching by her mistress’s bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Has she moved?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh no, sir, she sleeps very sound,” answered the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is well. Keep her very still. Keep the room dark and quiet. Do not\\r\\n\\n\\nleave her until my return. If she should wake in the meantime, tell her\\r\\n\\n\\nthat I was compelled to ride into town this morning; but that I shall be\\r\\n\\n\\nback early. Do you hear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir; and I will be very careful to do as you say.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander then drew on his gloves and left the room. When he got down\\r\\n\\n\\nstairs he repeated to Leo his orders, that the house should be kept very\\r\\n\\n\\nquiet. Then he mounted his horse and rode rapidly towards the city. He\\r\\n\\n\\nwas an hour behind his usual time, and it was noon when he reached his\\r\\n\\n\\nroom at the hotel. He was glad to find out by inquiry that no one had\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled that morning to see him. So he went down stairs to call a cab, to\\r\\n\\n\\ntake him to his uncle’s lodgings. He found the hotel halls, as well as\\r\\n\\n\\nthe city streets, full of bustle. Yesterday had been the last day of the\\r\\n\\n\\nsession of Congress, and to-day there was a general evacuation of the\\r\\n\\n\\ncity, by members of the house and senate, and by the troops of friends\\r\\n\\n\\nand strangers that attend or follow them to and from Washington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick found it hard to get an empty cab, so he hailed an omnibus, and\\r\\n\\n\\nrode on as far as it would take him to his uncle’s lodgings, and then\\r\\n\\n\\ngot out and walked the rest of the way.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe general had just left his bedroom; but he received his visitor very\\r\\n\\n\\ncordially.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I tell you what, Alick, these fashionable hours don’t suit an\\r\\n\\n\\nold-fashioned fellow like myself. And I am heartily glad the season is\\r\\n\\n\\nover. As soon as Anna comes down I shall tell her to give orders to pack\\r\\n\\n\\nup; for we shall leave in a day or two—just as soon as the great crush\\r\\n\\n\\nof travellers shall thin off, so that the steamboats and the railway\\r\\n\\n\\ntrains will not be so overcrowded. By the way, I hope you made it all\\r\\n\\n\\nright with Anna last night?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please to recollect, my dear sir, that I could not possibly get an\\r\\n\\n\\nopportunity of speaking to her in private. But I shall make one to-day.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right, my dear boy, and I will help you. And I hope you will make\\r\\n\\n\\nup your mind to leave this babel when we do. What is to prevent you, eh?\\r\\n\\n\\nYou might go back with us to the old hall.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I should be very happy to do so, sir; and if I can make arrangements——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, bosh about arrangements! What arrangements can an idle young man\\r\\n\\n\\nlike you have to make? None that could not be made in twenty-four hours.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd we shall not leave for at least forty-eight.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will try to be ready, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs Alick spoke, Anna came in.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe wore an elegant morning robe of white cashmere lined and faced with\\r\\n\\n\\nquilted white satin, and trimmed with black velvet and jet, and fastened\\r\\n\\n\\naround the waist with a black silk cord and tassels. She seemed no worse\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her long season of fashionable dissipation, but looked stately,\\r\\n\\n\\nblooming and beautiful as ever.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander arose and greeted her with more than usual empressement, and\\r\\n\\n\\nled her to a seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe breakfast was served. And the general telling Alexander that it\\r\\n\\n\\nwould do quite as well for a luncheon, invited him to sit down to the\\r\\n\\n\\ntable.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile lingering over the late morning meal, they talked of the just\\r\\n\\n\\nclosed session of Congress and season of fashion, and the general again\\r\\n\\n\\npressed Alick to join his party at old Lyon Hall. And in the presence of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis beautiful betrothed, Alick could neither refuse nor hesitate to\\r\\n\\n\\naccept the invitation. So he gave his promise to accompany his uncle and\\r\\n\\n\\ncousin to their home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter the breakfast was finished, and the service was removed, the\\r\\n\\n\\ngeneral arose, saying that he would go down into the reading-room and\\r\\n\\n\\nlook over the morning papers, he left the parlor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander and Anna were alone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“At last, then, I have the opportunity of speaking to you, that I have\\r\\n\\n\\nso long desired,” whispered Alick, as he went and took a seat on the\\r\\n\\n\\nsofa, by the side of his betrothed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe received him very quietly, if not coldly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe then went on to lament the repeated interruptions that had so long\\r\\n\\n\\ndelayed their union, and to press her to name an early day for the\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Your great haste is of very late date, Alick. I saw no signs of such\\r\\n\\n\\nimpatience, until within the last few weeks,” she answered coolly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe gave her a deprecating look, and pleaded:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My love was chilled and my pride was hurt by your marked preference for\\r\\n\\n\\nmy rival.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush!” said Anna, quickly. “Let poor Dick alone. He is honest, if he is\\r\\n\\n\\nwild. I have sent him away. Let him go in peace.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Just so! Let him go. But you will grant my request?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have no wish to break off our engagement, Alick. I will not be the\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst woman of my race to break my pledged word. I will give you my\\r\\n\\n\\npromised hand; but not as soon as you ask. Let the year of mourning end\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That will be in November.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; you must wait until then.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander heaved a deep sigh, and got up and walked the room, and looked\\r\\n\\n\\na great deal more disappointed than he felt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn truth—now he knew that his hand was free from legal fetters to\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, he felt that his heart was more bound to her by affection than\\r\\n\\n\\nhe had lately believed. And now his hated rival was out of his way, he\\r\\n\\n\\nfound that he was not half so much in love with his beautiful cousin as\\r\\n\\n\\nhe had imagined.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so he really had no more desire to hurry the wedding than had Anna\\r\\n\\n\\nherself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe wanted more time to break with her whom he had so long taken for his\\r\\n\\n\\nwife. And as he walked up and down the floor, he was thinking most of\\r\\n\\n\\nher.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor little Drusa,” he thought. “Good little Drusa, from this hour she\\r\\n\\n\\nmust be to me, only as a dear little sister. But our parting must not he\\r\\n\\n\\nabrupt. Such a shock would be her death-blow, poor child! Little by\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle I must leave her. This trip to the old hall will be a good start.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe need not know where or why I go. I can tell her that this business\\r\\n\\n\\nconnected with my father’s will, takes me into Virginia for a while—and\\r\\n\\n\\nthis will be true, so far as it goes. After a few weeks I will return to\\r\\n\\n\\nher, but only as a brother, and will stay with her but a few days. And\\r\\n\\n\\nthen the second absence shall be longer than the first, and the second\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn to her, shorter. And so, gently, most gently will I loose the tie\\r\\n\\n\\nthat binds her to me, so that when the final parting comes, she shall\\r\\n\\n\\nscarcely feel it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo, as falsely as wickedly, he reasoned. For it would have been more\\r\\n\\n\\nmerciful to have broken with her at once than to leave her by degrees.\\r\\n\\n\\nMuch kinder would be the quick, sharp death-blow that should end her woe\\r\\n\\n\\ninstantly, than the slow, cruel torture that would as surely if not as\\r\\n\\n\\nswiftly destroy her life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSomething of this truth seemed to strike his mind. He groaned slightly.\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he began to comfort his conscience.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will provide for her,” he said to himself. “I will buy that little\\r\\n\\n\\nestate for her. She can live there as a young widow. She can——Oh, great\\r\\n\\n\\nHeaven, what a villain I am growing to be! But I cannot help it. I\\r\\n\\n\\ncannot remarry Drusilla because I am bound to Anna, and have been bound\\r\\n\\n\\nto her for many years. So I cannot but do as I do. I wonder if murderers\\r\\n\\n\\ncan help killing, or thieves stealing? Or if really I can help being the\\r\\n\\n\\nwretch I am?” And as he mentally asked himself this question his face\\r\\n\\n\\ngrew so dark with pain and remorse, that Anna, who had been watching him\\r\\n\\n\\nand who quite mistook his mood, laughed and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, Alick, one would really think, to see you, that you take this\\r\\n\\n\\nmatter to heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I take the matter to heart much more than you believe, Anna,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered, speaking, as had been his frequent manner of late, true in the\\r\\n\\n\\nletter and false in the spirit of his reply. Then lest his supposed\\r\\n\\n\\ndisappointment should cause her to relent and to fix an earlier day for\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir marriage than would quite be convenient for him, he hastened to\\r\\n\\n\\nadd: “But let it be as you will, fair cousin. I will wait with what\\r\\n\\n\\npatience I may until November.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna pouted, for although she was in no haste to marry she felt\\r\\n\\n\\naffronted that Alick should yield the point so readily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick staid and dined with his uncle and cousin that day. And after\\r\\n\\n\\ndinner he would have taken leave to go home, but his uncle stopped him,\\r\\n\\n\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, indeed, my boy. This is the first evening since we have been in\\r\\n\\n\\nWashington that I have had you all to myself, and I mean to have the\\r\\n\\n\\ngood of you. Every other evening you have had to dance attendance on\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna to some place of amusement. There is no place to go to this\\r\\n\\n\\nevening, thank Heaven. And Anna is tired and is going to rest, so you\\r\\n\\n\\njust sit down and play a game of chess with me. Come, I will let you off\\r\\n\\n\\nat ten o’clock, but not a moment before.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo Alexander sat down to the chess-board with his uncle and played until\\r\\n\\n\\nten o’clock; and then bade him good night, and started for home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\\r\\n\\n\\n                               HER LOVE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n            Hers is the love which keeps\\r\\n\\n\\n              A constant watch-fire light,\\r\\n\\n\\n            With a flame that never sleeps\\r\\n\\n\\n              Through the longest winter night.—ELIZA COOK.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Drusilla slept long and deeply, like one much worn in mind\\r\\n\\n\\nand body. It was afternoon when she opened her eyes. She saw Pina\\r\\n\\n\\nsitting by her side. At first, she thought it was yet early in the\\r\\n\\n\\nmorning, and that she had awakened at her usual hour, and she wondered\\r\\n\\n\\nwhy her maid should be watching by her bed; but in another moment,\\r\\n\\n\\nmemory returned and reminded her of all the events of the day. And she\\r\\n\\n\\nthought of Alexander’s loving kindness to her, and she smiled with\\r\\n\\n\\ndelight. Then she asked:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where is Mr. Lyon?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He is gone to town, ma’am,” answered Pina.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe little lady’s face fell. Its gladness was all gone in an instant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gone to town again, Pina?” she repeated in a sad tone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, which he told me to tell you, as he was unwillin’ compelled\\r\\n\\n\\nfor to go, and which he would be sure to come back very early,” said the\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl, in her good nature; adding a little to her master’s message.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh! did he say that, Pina? Did he say he would come back very early?\\r\\n\\n\\nAre you sure, Pina?” And the little face brightened up again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sure as sure, ma’am; which ‘very early’ was his very words,” said Pina,\\r\\n\\n\\ntelling a little white lie.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What time is it now?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Near five, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then he will soon be here,” she said. And strengthened by this hope,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe threw off the counterpane, and got out of bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith the help of her maid she dressed herself as carefully to please her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband’s taste, as a maiden might to attract a lover’s eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she went down stairs to see if the drawing-room was made\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfortable for the evening. She found that Leo had done his duty in the\\r\\n\\n\\nmatter. The fire in the grate was burning brightly; the hearth was\\r\\n\\n\\nshining clearly; the deep sofa was drawn up on one side of the chimney,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the easy chair on the other, and the round table was placed between\\r\\n\\n\\nthem. The front blinds were left as usual unclosed until the master’s\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn; but the crimson curtains were drawn before the windows. The\\r\\n\\n\\nchandelier was lighted, and its rays were reflected back by the pictured\\r\\n\\n\\nwalls, the gilded mirrors and the glowing draperies of the room, so that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe little retreat looked very cozy and home-like.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, this is all very well; but there are no flowers,” said this loving\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle wife; (for wife we must call her, notwithstanding Mr. Alick’s\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovery;) and she went into her small conservatory and cut a few\\r\\n\\n\\nfragrant tea roses and lemon geraniums, and arranged them in a beautiful\\r\\n\\n\\ngroup, and placed them in a vase, and set them on the round table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then she opened her piano and selected from her music some of her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband’s favorite pieces, and laid them in readiness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He is so fond of music, and he likes my voice and touch, and yet he so\\r\\n\\n\\nseldom hears me sing or play now. Perhaps he will to-night, though,” she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, as she sat down to try the tone of her long neglected instrument.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe had taken no food since morning, for in fact, her long sleep had\\r\\n\\n\\nkept her from feeling the want of it; but soon she felt faint from\\r\\n\\n\\nhunger, and she got up to ring the bell for a cup of tea.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Pina, who had not forgotten her mistress’s needs, was even now on\\r\\n\\n\\nher way to the drawing-room with the tea tray.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe brought it in and sat it down on the table, and stood waiting\\r\\n\\n\\norders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Did your master say he would be home to dinner, Pina?” the little lady\\r\\n\\n\\nasked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, ma’am; he said ‘very early’ to _me_. And when Leo asked him if\\r\\n\\n\\ndinner should be prepared for him, he said ‘no,’ and that he should ‘be\\r\\n\\n\\nhome to an early tea,’” the girl replied.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, here; I will only take half a cup of that oolong and half a\\r\\n\\n\\nbiscuit to keep me up till he comes, for I wish to take tea with him\\r\\n\\n\\nthis evening,” said the little wife, as she hastily took the bit and sup\\r\\n\\n\\nshe spoke of.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, take this down, Pina; and listen,” she added, as she pushed away\\r\\n\\n\\nthe tray. “Have a very nice tea got ready—the oolong and the imperial,\\r\\n\\n\\nmixed half and half as he likes it; and make some sweet muffins; and\\r\\n\\n\\nslice that venison tongue; and open those West India sweetmeats,\\r\\n\\n\\nespecially the preserved green figs and the pineapples. Do you hear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, madam.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And will you remember all?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, madam, I will be sure to.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina left the room, and her mistress resumed her practising.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe went over all his favorite pieces in turn, stopping at the end of\\r\\n\\n\\neach to go to the window, and watch and listen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut hour after hour passed by, and still he for whom she looked came\\r\\n\\n\\nnot. As night deepened, her spirits sank.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps he will not come at all,” she said, with a sigh. “Something\\r\\n\\n\\nkeeps him that he cannot help,” she added, in excuse for him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the clock struck ten she could hardly keep back her tears.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He will not be home until very late, even if he comes to-night,” she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, with a deep sob, as she closed the piano and sat down by the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe waited then for her servants to come as usual for orders, before\\r\\n\\n\\nbidding her good night. Then, as they did not appear, she rang for them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when Pina entered, her mistress said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is long past your bed time.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know it, madam; but master, he gave us such a rowing for leaving you\\r\\n\\n\\nalone last night, after you had been frightened the night before, that\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo and me, we daren’t go. We’ll sit in the kitchen, if you please,\\r\\n\\n\\nma’am, or wait in the hall, as you order, until the master returns.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He may not be able to get home to-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, please, ma’am, we’ll have to sit up and watch, or sleep anywhere\\r\\n\\n\\nin the house as you’ll appoint.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla reflected for a moment, and then said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You may sit up in the kitchen for an hour longer, and then come to me\\r\\n\\n\\nfor orders.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl left the room, and her mistress sank back in her resting chair,\\r\\n\\n\\nrepeating to herself,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He knows that I am ill and nervous, and almost unprotected here; and he\\r\\n\\n\\nleft me word he would be back early. Oh, surely he will keep his\\r\\n\\n\\npromise, in part, at least, by coming back some time to-night. He will\\r\\n\\n\\nif he can! I am sure he will, if he can!” she added, confidingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut as the next hour wore slowly on, her long tried courage utterly\\r\\n\\n\\nbroke down, and she bowed her head upon the table and wept bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe clock was striking eleven, when two sounds from opposite ways struck\\r\\n\\n\\nher ear. One was the galloping of a horse’s feet coming to the house.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe other was the running of her servants up the back stairs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla hastily wiped her eyes as Pina entered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Your master has come. Send Leo around to the stable to take his horse,\\r\\n\\n\\nand do you bring up the supper-tray,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the girl left the room to obey orders; but before going down stairs\\r\\n\\n\\nshe went and unlocked the front door, and set it slightly ajar, that her\\r\\n\\n\\nmaster might enter at once when he should reach the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla meanwhile tried to still the spasmodic sobs that were yet\\r\\n\\n\\nheaving her bosom, and to force back the tears that were yet wetting her\\r\\n\\n\\neyes, and to put on a pleasant face to meet her beloved. But it is not\\r\\n\\n\\nso easy all at once to suppress nervous excitement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo when Alexander hurried through the hall door, locking it as he\\r\\n\\n\\npassed, and hurried into the drawing-room to see her, she was still\\r\\n\\n\\nsobbing and weeping.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe stopped short in surprise and some anger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, Drusa! why, what is all this row about?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, Alick!” she gasped, her nerves being all unstrung, “I did\\r\\n\\n\\nnot think you would have stayed away from me to-night! I have been\\r\\n\\n\\nwaiting for you so long, as I have waited for you so often! oh, so\\r\\n\\n\\noften!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is that meant for a reproach, Drusilla?” he asked, coldly, as he\\r\\n\\n\\ndropped into a chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, Alick! no dear, no! but I can not—can not help it!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she cried harder than ever.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, this is a pretty way to meet a man, upon my word, after he has\\r\\n\\n\\ntaken a long cold ride to see you,” said Mr. Lyon, angrily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I didn’t mean it, Alick! Indeed I didn’t, dear! I tried hard to help\\r\\n\\n\\nit; but I couldn’t. I broke down,” she cried, sobbing heavily between\\r\\n\\n\\nher words.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Humph, this is pleasant, upon my soul,” he said, grimly, watching her\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout making one attempt to soothe her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know—I know how bad it is in me to do so, Alick dear, and I’m trying\\r\\n\\n\\nto stop it; indeed I am. Bear with me a little, dear; I will stop soon,\\r\\n\\n\\nindeed I will,” she sobbed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope it will be very soon. This looks very much as if you were\\r\\n\\n\\naccusing me of misusing you, Drusilla; do you mean to say that I do?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, no, no, Alick! I never even thought so! You are very good to\\r\\n\\n\\nme. It is not your fault, dear; it is mine. I don’t know what ails me\\r\\n\\n\\nthat I cry so much at such little things. I feel like a baby that wants\\r\\n\\n\\nits mother’s lap,” she said, with a still heaving bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is very childish, Drusilla,” he answered, in a harsh,\\r\\n\\n\\nunsympathizing manner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know it is, dear. I am sorry I am so foolish; it is because I am so,\\r\\n\\n\\nso lonely, Alick. Oh, so lonely, dear, you can’t think; it is like\\r\\n\\n\\ndeath—like heart-break. But it is not your fault, dear; I don’t mean\\r\\n\\n\\nthat; don’t you think that. You are not to blame, Alick; it is I. But\\r\\n\\n\\nthen, dear, think of this, and bear with me a little. I have no one in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe wide world but only you; and when you are away all is so still, so\\r\\n\\n\\nsilent—oh, so dreary you don’t know. If I only had a mother to turn to\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen I feel so weak and foolish, and so lonesome—if I could only lay my\\r\\n\\n\\nhead down on my mother’s shoulder when you are away, and cry a little I\\r\\n\\n\\nshould be better; I should be all right when you should return home. But\\r\\n\\n\\nI have no mother to go to, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you had she would box your ears for such nonsense; that is, if I\\r\\n\\n\\nremember the old lady rightly,” said Alexander, brutally, as he arose\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom his chair and walked the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut her nervous excitement was now subsiding. Her tears ceased to flow;\\r\\n\\n\\nher sobs were softer. Presently she wiped her eyes, and, smiling like\\r\\n\\n\\nsunshine through raindrops, she said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is all over now, Alick dear, all quite over. It was only a summer\\r\\n\\n\\ngust, dear, and it did me no harm; and you will excuse it this once,\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall hardly know how to do so if this exhibition is ever to be\\r\\n\\n\\nrepeated,” he growled.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope it never will be, Alick,” she said, with a subsiding sigh, as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe arose and touched the bell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, if you knew as much as I do you would very carefully avoid\\r\\n\\n\\ngiving me any annoyance,” he said, in so meaning a manner that her hand\\r\\n\\n\\ndropped from the bell-pull, and she turned to him in dismay, and, gazing\\r\\n\\n\\non him, asked:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is it that you know, Alick, dear? Indeed I never wish to annoy\\r\\n\\n\\nyou. But what is it you mean, dear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No matter! You will know some day; all too soon whenever that day shall\\r\\n\\n\\ncome,” he said, evasively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, Alick dear, you frighten me. Please what is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No matter what. Let the subject drop, Drusilla,” he replied, repenting\\r\\n\\n\\nthe cruelty that made him allude to the guilty secret of his own breast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, dear Alick——” she re-commenced.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Let the subject drop, I say,” he interrupted her, in a tone so\\r\\n\\n\\nperemptory that she immediately bowed her head and obeyed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Pina now entered the room with the tray, and laid the cloth for\\r\\n\\n\\nsupper. And having done so she retired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen Mr. Lyon had supped to his satisfaction, and felt himself in a\\r\\n\\n\\nbetter humor, he turned around to the blazing fire, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have a mind to sit up and watch to-night for that face at the window”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do, dear Alick, if you are not too tired,” she answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I will sit with my revolver by my side.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, do; and with me also.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But you are not able to sit up.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I am. You know I slept nearly all day. And I do wish to watch\\r\\n\\n\\nwith you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So be it then. But we must draw the curtains back from the windows, as\\r\\n\\n\\nthey were last night and all nights before. Who closed them to-night?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo did, I suppose, to keep the face from looking in and frightening me\\r\\n\\n\\nagain. And I did not change the arrangement, because I reflected that\\r\\n\\n\\nyou could see the light almost as well through these fine crimson\\r\\n\\n\\ncurtains as glass itself.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is true. It is a pity you or one of your servants had not thought\\r\\n\\n\\nof this before. It would have saved you a fright.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, Alick, dear, if any dangerous person were lurking about the\\r\\n\\n\\npremises, is it not better that I should have detected him, even at the\\r\\n\\n\\ncost of a fright, than that he should be let to go on and do the\\r\\n\\n\\nmischief he is plotting, whatever that is?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There is something in what you say, my brave little wi—woman,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe did not perceive how he caught and corrected his words, for she was\\r\\n\\n\\nbusy drawing back the curtains of one window, while he did the like with\\r\\n\\n\\nthose of the other.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander went and got his small revolver from the pocket of his riding\\r\\n\\n\\ncoat and laid it on the table beside him. And then they sat down to wait\\r\\n\\n\\nthe issue.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt first they talked a little in low voices. Alexander would make\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla tell him again and again the particulars of her two frights.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she had so little to tell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Only a white stern face, looking in at me through the dark window.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander questioned her as to the hour of its appearance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It was at two o’clock on the first night. And at one o’clock on the\\r\\n\\n\\nsecond night,” she answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Exactly; and if it keeps on coming an hour later each night, it will\\r\\n\\n\\nappear at twelve precisely to-night. And it now wants just ten minutes\\r\\n\\n\\nto that time,” said Alexander, with a laugh.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he questioned her as to her thoughts, feelings and occupations at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe time she saw the face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla replied that she was reading, and confessed that she was\\r\\n\\n\\nthinking of supernatural beings and feeling a little afraid of looking\\r\\n\\n\\nover her shoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Precisely; and now let me ask you _what_ were you reading?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I had been reading ‘The Night Side of Nature,’” replied Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Alexander, “the secret is out! The face at the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow was an optical illusion created by your over-excited imagination.\\r\\n\\n\\nNext time, my little love, read Scott’s ‘Demonology.’ It will be a\\r\\n\\n\\nperfect antidote to the ‘Night Side of Nature.’ I don’t wonder, poor\\r\\n\\n\\nchild! that you were afraid to look over your shoulder, or that you saw\\r\\n\\n\\nfaces glaring at you through dark windows. I wonder you didn’t see a\\r\\n\\n\\nspectral face grinning through every single pane of glass. Ha! ha! ha!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ha! ha! ha!” echoed another voice—a strange, harsh, unearthly voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander started and looked at his companion, who was pale as death.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Ha! ha! ha!_” shouted the voice again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe then seized his revolver and turned quickly to the window whence the\\r\\n\\n\\nvoice seemed to come.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“HA! HA! HA!” it shrieked a third time, as Alexander caught a glimpse of\\r\\n\\n\\na ghastly, grinning face that showed itself for an instant at the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow, and he levelled his pistol. But as he fired it, it dropped and\\r\\n\\n\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stay here while I search the grounds,” whispered Mr. Lyon to his\\r\\n\\n\\npanic-stricken companion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd revolver still in hand, he ran out of the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla sat with her hands clasped tightly together, her face white as\\r\\n\\n\\na sheet and her heart half paralyzed with fright. She had not long to\\r\\n\\n\\nwait. A pistol shot, followed by another and another in quick\\r\\n\\n\\nsuccession, startled her. With a wild cry she sprang to her feet and\\r\\n\\n\\nrushed out to the help of her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\\r\\n\\n\\n                               BREAKING.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n               They’d met e’er yet the world had come,\\r\\n\\n\\n                 To wither up the springs of truth;\\r\\n\\n\\n               Amid the holy joys of home,\\r\\n\\n\\n                 And in the first warm flush of youth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n               They parted, not as lovers part,\\r\\n\\n\\n                 With earnest vows of constancy—\\r\\n\\n\\n               She with her wronged and bleeding heart,\\r\\n\\n\\n                 And he rejoicing to be free!—ANONYMOUS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick! Alick! Oh, Alick, where are you? Answer me! Speak to me, if you\\r\\n\\n\\ncan! Oh, give me some sign where to search for you,” Drusilla cried,\\r\\n\\n\\nrunning wildly out into the wintry night, in the direction from which\\r\\n\\n\\nshe had heard the shots, and fearing at every point to find her husband\\r\\n\\n\\ndead or wounded.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush!” whispered a voice through the darkness. And the next moment her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband stood by her side.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, thank Heaven you are alive and safe! You _are_ safe, are you\\r\\n\\n\\nnot, dear?” she eagerly inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; but that infernal villain has got off!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, never mind, so that you are not hurt. You are _not_ hurt, are you,\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; I have not been in any danger; but that cursed caitiff! he has\\r\\n\\n\\nescaped!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh dear, let him go; so you are sure you are not wounded? You _are_\\r\\n\\n\\nsure, are you not, dear? You are quite sure neither of those shots\\r\\n\\n\\nstruck you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The shots were fired by my own hand, and I’m only sorry they missed\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir mark, and that diabolical scoundrel got off! He ran like a quarter\\r\\n\\n\\nhorse, Devil fly away with him! I would have given a thousand dollars to\\r\\n\\n\\nhave him here with my foot on his neck! By all I hold sacred, I would!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh Alick, do stop thinking about him, and think about yourself! You are\\r\\n\\n\\nso excited I don’t believe you know whether you are wounded or not; you\\r\\n\\n\\nmay be bleeding to death now, somewhere under your coat! Oh Alick, dear,\\r\\n\\n\\ncome in the house and let me look.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is you who are excited, little goose. You are shaking like an ague!\\r\\n\\n\\nCome in the house yourself, and get warm and quiet,” he said, tucking\\r\\n\\n\\nher under his arm and leading her towards the cottage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But Alick, dear, tell me, are you _very_ certain—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, I’m not ‘_very_’ certain; I’m only just _certain_ that I have not a\\r\\n\\n\\nsingle scratch. That—that—miserable miscreant was unarmed, I suppose,\\r\\n\\n\\nSatan burn him!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who was he, Alick, do you know?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How should I? I only know that he was some felon spy, who has doubtless\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen hanging about the house, and peeping through the windows o’\\r\\n\\n\\nnights.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A spy, Alick? Only a spy? Why I thought he was a robber and a\\r\\n\\n\\nmurderer.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My little love, a spy is the most dangerous character of the three. We\\r\\n\\n\\nmay defend ourselves against robbers and murderers; but not against\\r\\n\\n\\nspies. The first are beasts of prey; but the last are venomous\\r\\n\\n\\nserpents—snakes in the grass. No one knows how long that infamous wretch\\r\\n\\n\\nhas been lurking around our house, or how often he has been peeping in\\r\\n\\n\\nat our windows, or how much he has seen.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear Alick, we have only seen _him_ three times.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But he may have seen us, three hundred times. Of course our eyes were\\r\\n\\n\\nnot always on the window.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is true; but, after all, what of it, Alick? He could not harm us\\r\\n\\n\\nby looking at us,” said the honest young creature, who knew she had\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing to hide.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ugh! if I had him under my feet, I would not leave a whole bone in his\\r\\n\\n\\nbody!” cried the double-dealing man, who was conscious that he had a\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat deal to conceal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, never mind, Alick, dear. For my part, I am well content that the\\r\\n\\n\\nman got off, and you have no broken bones to account for. For, after\\r\\n\\n\\nall, he committed no great crime in looking in at a lighted window at\\r\\n\\n\\nnight. Why, Alick, in walking through the streets of the city in the\\r\\n\\n\\nevening you and I used to do the same thing, only for the harmless\\r\\n\\n\\npleasure of looking in to an interior, upon a pretty domestic picture of\\r\\n\\n\\na family circle around their tea-table, or something of the sort. And\\r\\n\\n\\nthis man might have had no worse purpose.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“His purpose, whatever it might have been, should have cost him his life\\r\\n\\n\\nif I had caught him!” said Mr. Lyon, grimly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I am truly glad you did not catch him. Oh, be content, Alick, for\\r\\n\\n\\nyou may be sure, now that the man has been seen and chased, he will\\r\\n\\n\\nnever come to trouble us again!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know that he will. But he didn’t seem to dread being seen,\\r\\n\\n\\nhowever. It was his taunting laugh, you know, that drew my notice to\\r\\n\\n\\nhim. He seemed to try to catch my eye by mocking my laugh. I think he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad seen all he wished to see, and that this was to be his last visit;\\r\\n\\n\\nso he let his presence be known, to annoy us. Ah! if I ever find out who\\r\\n\\n\\nhe is, he shall pay dearly for his frolic!” exclaimed Alick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBy this time they reached the house and entered it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander made Drusilla sit down in the easy chair before the fire, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthen he went and carefully closed and fastened the doors and windows,\\r\\n\\n\\nand finally came and took a seat by her side.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd they sat there a little while to warm and rest themselves before\\r\\n\\n\\ngoing up stairs to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick,” said Drusilla, “I hope if you ever do find out who that man is,\\r\\n\\n\\nyou will do him no harm.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will be his death,” exclaimed Alexander, grinding his teeth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, no, no; he may have been some poor forlorn creature, who having no\\r\\n\\n\\nhome of his own, looked in upon ours, as upon a paradise.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He was, more likely, some vulgar wretch, who in prowling about here at\\r\\n\\n\\nnight, after game, has found out that a very pretty little woman lives\\r\\n\\n\\nhere, often all alone, and has made up his mind to get as many peeps at\\r\\n\\n\\nher as he can.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is the secret, now I come to think quietly over the matter, my\\r\\n\\n\\ndear; and your brilliantly lighted windows were the beacons that first\\r\\n\\n\\ndrew him here to gaze on you at will; to feast his eyes on your beauty;\\r\\n\\n\\nperhaps to fall in love with you! Come, what do you think of it all\\r\\n\\n\\nnow?” inquired Mr. Lyon, maliciously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, Alick, don’t talk so to me. I am your wife. Such thoughts——”\\r\\n\\n\\nShe paused, and blushing deeply, turned away her head.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is the matter, little love?” he laughed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You should not breathe such thoughts to me, dear Alick. But—I shall\\r\\n\\n\\ndraw the curtains before the windows every evening in future.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think it would be just as well you should do so. The light shining\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough their crimson folds will be enough to guide me home at night,”\\r\\n\\n\\nhe said, as he arose and lighted the bedroom candles.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe set the guard up before the grate, and put out the lamps.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey left the drawing-room and went up stairs together; but when they\\r\\n\\n\\nreached their chamber door, he put one of the candles in her hand,\\r\\n\\n\\nsaying kindly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good night, my dear child. I hope you will have a good sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd before she could answer, he opened the door of an opposite chamber,\\r\\n\\n\\npassed in and locked it behind him, leaving her standing still in\\r\\n\\n\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was the first time, while at home, that he had ever slept out of\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir mutual room. She could not imagine why he should do so now. If he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad not spoken so kindly to her, she might have supposed he was angry\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her. But his good night had been even unusually gentle and tender;\\r\\n\\n\\nit had seemed almost plaintive and deprecating. But then he had not only\\r\\n\\n\\npassed their chamber and gone into another room, but he had locked the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor behind him, thus securing himself against possible intrusion. Whose\\r\\n\\n\\nintrusion? she asked herself—hers, his wife’s? Well, she was his wife,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe thought; but dearly as she loved him, scarcely living, except by his\\r\\n\\n\\nside, she would never intrude upon his chosen solitude.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe stood there in perplexed and painful thought, inquiring and\\r\\n\\n\\nwondering why he left her and locked her out. Perhaps, after all, she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid to herself, he was still a little angry with her, for having cried\\r\\n\\n\\nso much that evening. She must find out. She could not go to rest, she\\r\\n\\n\\nwould never be able to sleep without knowing whether he was really\\r\\n\\n\\ndispleased with her, and reconciling him to herself. She would not\\r\\n\\n\\nintrude upon him, she thought, no, never! But she would rap at his door\\r\\n\\n\\nand ask if she had offended him, and if so, she would do all that she\\r\\n\\n\\ncould to atone for such offence. For she must make friends with him\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore she left the spot, or—die!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo she went and rapped at his door and then waited.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe heard him moving about the room, but he made no response.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe thought he had not heard her, so she rapped again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well! Who is there?” he inquired from within.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is I, your little Drusa, Alick,” she answered, in a low and\\r\\n\\n\\ntremulous tone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What do you want, Drusilla?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick dear, my heart is breaking; please don’t be mad with me,” she\\r\\n\\n\\npleaded, in her most plaintive voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am not mad with you, child; why should you think so?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, I thought—I thought you were displeased, because—because—”\\r\\n\\n\\nShe could not go on.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What reason could I have for being angry with you, child?” he asked\\r\\n\\n\\nagain, putting his question in a form that he thought she could more\\r\\n\\n\\neasily answer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, my crying so much this evening,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, bosh! that is all over now. No, little Drusa, I have no cause, no\\r\\n\\n\\njust cause of complaint against you. If I am ever angry with you, it is\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom my own quick temper, and by no fault of yours, my child. Now go to\\r\\n\\n\\nbed like a good girl, or rather like a sweet little saint as you truly\\r\\n\\n\\nare. Good night, my little Drusa,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good night, dear Alick,” she answered, turning sadly away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe went to her own room and set the candle on the mantle-piece, sank\\r\\n\\n\\ninto her easy chair, and lapsed into sorrowful thought.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He said he was not angry with me; yes, he said so; but he never told me\\r\\n\\n\\nwhy he left my room, and he never even opened the door to speak to me,\\r\\n\\n\\nnor yet kissed me good night. No, he is not angry with me; not angry,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut sick and tired of me, as I might have known he would be; for what am\\r\\n\\n\\nI to please him who has been used to ladies of the highest rank and\\r\\n\\n\\nculture? Yes, he is sick and tired of me, and it is not his fault—it is\\r\\n\\n\\nmine; and I wish, oh, I wish, it were no sin to die!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she dropped her head upon the arm of her chair and wept bitterly;\\r\\n\\n\\nwept till she was so exhausted that she slipped from the chair to the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarpet, and, grovelling there, wept on.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer tears like her grief, seemed inexhaustible; for, when the daylight\\r\\n\\n\\ndawned and the sun rose, she was still lying where she had sunk overcome\\r\\n\\n\\nwith sorrow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length when the morning was well advanced, she remembered her\\r\\n\\n\\nhousewifely duties, and slowly got up and rang the bell for her maid.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen, lest her evening dress should excite the girl’s curiosity, as it\\r\\n\\n\\ndid on a former occasion, she quickly took it off and threw around her a\\r\\n\\n\\nchamber wrapper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina came in and put fresh logs on the fire, and filled the ewers, and\\r\\n\\n\\nlaid out clean towels, and then stood waiting.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There is nothing more, Pina; you may go,” said her mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the maid left the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla bathed her eyes and face, and combed her hair, and dressed\\r\\n\\n\\nherself as tastefully as if she had slept through a happy night and\\r\\n\\n\\nwaked to a gladsome morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she went down stairs to see to the breakfast. The cozy drawing-room,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe bright fire, the clean hearth, the neat table, all the accessories\\r\\n\\n\\nof her sweet home, and, above all, the clear sunshiny morning, early\\r\\n\\n\\nharbinger of spring, cheered her spirits and inspired more hopeful\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughts than had been hers on the evening previous.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick loved me from my childhood,” she said, “and chose me freely for\\r\\n\\n\\nhis wife from all others that he might have had. And he is very good to\\r\\n\\n\\nme. He spoke gently to me even last night. Perhaps he is not so weary of\\r\\n\\n\\nme as I think. Perhaps he loves me still. And my doubts come only from\\r\\n\\n\\nmy own fancies. Oh, Heaven grant that it may be so. I will see how he\\r\\n\\n\\nwill meet me this morning. But, oh! if I should be so keen to note every\\r\\n\\n\\nword and look that he gives me, or don’t give me, how ill I should\\r\\n\\n\\nrequite his love. Shall I turn jealous fool, and watch my Alick as if he\\r\\n\\n\\nwere a foe to be suspected, and not my dear husband to be loved and\\r\\n\\n\\ntrusted to the last? No, Alick, dear, no; I will do you no such wrong. I\\r\\n\\n\\nknow I’m a big little fool, but not such a one as that, either. What if\\r\\n\\n\\nhe did leave me last night. Perhaps he needed to be very quiet, after so\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch excitement as he has had these two nights. I am sure, I am so\\r\\n\\n\\nnervous sometimes that I cannot bear a movement or a ray of light in my\\r\\n\\n\\nroom, and why should he not be subject to the same moods, even if he is\\r\\n\\n\\na strong man? Come, I will trust my husband, as well as love him.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis reaction of feeling, brought about mostly by the blessed sunshine\\r\\n\\n\\nof morning and the benign influence of home, called back the color to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe young wife’s cheeks and the light to her eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander came down earlier than usual. And she arose from her seat to\\r\\n\\n\\nreceive his morning kiss.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she did not get it. He passed her, and dropped into his chair, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ring for breakfast, Drusa. I must get off to town sooner by an hour\\r\\n\\n\\nthis morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith a suppressed sigh, she pulled the bell; and when Pina appeared, she\\r\\n\\n\\nordered breakfast to be served immediately.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander was thoughtful even to gloom. He had to break to Drusilla the\\r\\n\\n\\nnews of his intended sudden departure. And he dreaded to do it, and he\\r\\n\\n\\ndid not know how to begin.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe morning meal was served. They sat down to the table. Drusilla poured\\r\\n\\n\\nout the coffee, and, in handing her husband his cup, she said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are not feeling well this morning, Alick, dear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Drusa, I am not well, in spirits at least. I have a very painful\\r\\n\\n\\nduty before me, little Drusa,” he answered, catching at this opening for\\r\\n\\n\\nhis discourse.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very sorry, Alick,” she replied, and then waited for his further\\r\\n\\n\\nspeech.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall be obliged to leave home for a short time. I did not like to\\r\\n\\n\\ntell you last night, lest it should disturb your rest,” he said, little\\r\\n\\n\\nknowing how utterly his desertion had deprived her of that rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, dear, must you really go?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I must really go, Drusilla. That business connected with my father’s\\r\\n\\n\\nwill obliges me to do so,” he gravely said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Shall you take me with you, Alick?” she asked, in a low, timid voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Drusa; of course not. If I could take you along I should not feel\\r\\n\\n\\nso badly about going,” he answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, I am so sorry, dear.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall not stay very long, Drusa. I shall come back to you as soon as\\r\\n\\n\\nI possibly can, my child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know you will, Alick. Where do you go?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Into Virginia, of course, where our estates lie.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what a troublesome business that is connected with your father’s\\r\\n\\n\\nwill, to be sure—to bother you so much as it has ever since we have been\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried. Why cannot lawyers make wills so clear that there can be no\\r\\n\\n\\nmistake about their meaning?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, why indeed?” repeated Mr. Lyon, laughing in spite of his secret\\r\\n\\n\\nself-reproach.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“When do you start, dear Alick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To-morrow morning, my child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So soon! Oh, that is very sudden!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“These matters admit of no delay, Drusa. Now, my little woman, don’t\\r\\n\\n\\nlook so downcast. It is unpleasant enough for me to have to leave you.\\r\\n\\n\\nDon’t add to my vexation by your looks.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Alick, I will not if I can help it. You will want your clothes got\\r\\n\\n\\nready,” she added, cheerfully, “and the time is short. Tell me at once,\\r\\n\\n\\nplease, what you would like to take with you, and I will pack them up\\r\\n\\n\\nto-day.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, a dozen of each sort of under-garment; one morning and one evening\\r\\n\\n\\nsuit; my dressing-case and writing-case; those are all, I think. Have\\r\\n\\n\\nthem put into the little black Russia leather trunk.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will pack them myself, Alick dear, and then they will be sure to be\\r\\n\\n\\ndone right.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As you please, little woman.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How long shall you be gone, Alick? Can you tell me that?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, not exactly. The length of my absence depends upon circumstances.\\r\\n\\n\\nNot more than a week or ten days at most.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“At least you will be sure to be back within the fortnight?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, certainly. But you know we can talk over all this to-night, when I\\r\\n\\n\\nget back from town. I shall certainly be home to tea,” said Mr. Lyon, as\\r\\n\\n\\nhe arose from the table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I shall hope to see you. And I know you will come if you _can_,\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick,” she answered, as she thought of her constant disappointments in\\r\\n\\n\\nthis respect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe understood her, and he answered, as he drew on his riding-coat:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I _can_ be back this last evening, and I _will_. Good-bye until I see\\r\\n\\n\\nyou again, little Drusa.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he put on his hat and hurried out of the house, pulling on his\\r\\n\\n\\ngloves as he passed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the next moment he mounted his horse and galloped away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                             FIRST ABSENCE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           I heard thy light, careless farewell, love,\\r\\n\\n\\n             And patiently saw thee depart—\\r\\n\\n\\n           Ay, patiently. But could words tell, love,\\r\\n\\n\\n             The sorrow that swelled in my heart?\\r\\n\\n\\n           Yet tearless and still though I stood, love,\\r\\n\\n\\n             Thy last words are thrilling me yet,\\r\\n\\n\\n           And my lips would now breathe if they could, love,\\r\\n\\n\\n             The deep prayer—“Oh do not forget.”—ANON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla went to her own room, wept a little, and blamed herself for\\r\\n\\n\\nthat weakness, and then she called her maid to help her, and she spent\\r\\n\\n\\nthe whole day in preparing her husband’s wardrobe for his journey.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt happened for once that Mr. Lyon could keep his word to his wife\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout much personal inconvenience, and so he kept it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen he reached the city that day he made a morning call upon his uncle\\r\\n\\n\\nand his cousin. He found the General was engaged to dine that evening\\r\\n\\n\\nwith a veteran brother officer, and Miss Lyon would be occupied with the\\r\\n\\n\\npreparations for her journey, so that neither the old gentleman nor the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung lady would be at liberty to entertain him longer than the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter lunching with his relatives, and arranging to join them at nine\\r\\n\\n\\nthe next morning, he bade them good day.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe went to his own hotel where he called for his bill, settled it in\\r\\n\\n\\nfull, gave up the keys of his rooms, and so closed his connection with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFrom the hotel he went to the livery stable, mounted his horse and rode\\r\\n\\n\\nhomeward.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe reached Cedarwood at seven o’clock. He found his trunk ready packed,\\r\\n\\n\\ncorded and labelled for his journey, and standing in the hall. He found\\r\\n\\n\\nthe drawing-room as cozy and inviting as his wife always made it for his\\r\\n\\n\\nreception; the fire burning brightly, and the tea-table standing before\\r\\n\\n\\nit spread with all the dainties he most liked; and, above all, he found\\r\\n\\n\\n_her_, pretty, well-dressed, and cheerful as she could command herself\\r\\n\\n\\nto be.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was the first time for many weeks that he had taken tea with his\\r\\n\\n\\nwife, and she made it a festive occasion. He began again to realize that\\r\\n\\n\\nhe loved her; he felt like pressing her to his heart as in the first\\r\\n\\n\\ndays of their marriage, before the witchery of the world came between\\r\\n\\n\\nthem, or he had discovered what he supposed to be the illegality of\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir marriage. Yes, he would have liked to have shown her these proofs\\r\\n\\n\\nof reviving affection; but he did not. He had decided, in the secrecy of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis own insane mind, that she was henceforth to be only as a sister to\\r\\n\\n\\nhim until he should be able to part with her entirely; and so he treated\\r\\n\\n\\nher now very gently but very coldly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter tea, which he took care should be prolonged as far into the\\r\\n\\n\\nevening as possible, he asked her to sing and play for him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she very gladly sat down to the piano, and executed some of his\\r\\n\\n\\nfavorite pieces in her very best style.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe purposely kept her there, playing piece after piece, until she was\\r\\n\\n\\nreally wearied.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then when she rose from the instrument he took the lead in the\\r\\n\\n\\nconversation, and would talk of nothing but music, musicians, and\\r\\n\\n\\ncomposers until the clock struck eleven. Then he suddenly said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My little girl it is late, and you are tired; go to bed at once. I have\\r\\n\\n\\nletters to write that will detain me an hour or so. When I have finished\\r\\n\\n\\nthem I will come up.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick, dear, letters to write so late to-night when you have to start\\r\\n\\n\\nso early to-morrow?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, little Drusa.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why didn’t you write them earlier in the evening, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because I wanted to enjoy every moment of your company while you sat\\r\\n\\n\\nup, Drusa, and I knew I could write them after you had retired,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nartfully replied.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I had rather not leave you at all this last evening, Alick. I will\\r\\n\\n\\nsit very quietly near you and not interrupt you the least while you\\r\\n\\n\\nwrite your letters.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I will not permit you to do so, Drusa. You are pale with want of\\r\\n\\n\\nrest even now; and you will make a point of getting up to-morrow morning\\r\\n\\n\\neven sooner than I shall—I know you will.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I must, Alick dear, to see that you have a good breakfast ready in time\\r\\n\\n\\nto eat it leisurely before you go.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Just so; therefore you must go to rest now. There, be a good girl, and\\r\\n\\n\\nclear out, will you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick,” she answered, in a depressed tone. “Good night;” and she\\r\\n\\n\\nput up her lips to kiss him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bosh! no good night in the case. Do you think I am going to sit up till\\r\\n\\n\\nday writing letters?” he said, laughing and evading her caress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFeeling that something was very wrong, yet trying not to think so, she\\r\\n\\n\\nleft the room and went up stairs to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd after a little while, being almost worn out by so many nights’\\r\\n\\n\\nwatching, she fell asleep and slept until morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Alexander wrote a couple of trifling letters, and then, not\\r\\n\\n\\nto disturb her, he stole on tip-toes up to his newly chosen room and\\r\\n\\n\\nwent to rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla was the first up in the morning, before even her servants were\\r\\n\\n\\nastir. She roused Pina and set her to work, and helped with her own\\r\\n\\n\\nhands, and to such good purpose that a very nice breakfast was soon\\r\\n\\n\\nready and waiting for Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe came down, and greeted Drusilla kindly, but without his usual morning\\r\\n\\n\\nkiss. And she felt the slight; but neither spoke nor looked her chagrin.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You were so still that I thought you were asleep when I went up stairs\\r\\n\\n\\nlast night, so I took care not to wake you by entering your room; for\\r\\n\\n\\nyou needed rest very much, little Drusa,” he said, in explanation of his\\r\\n\\n\\nsecond desertion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick,” she answered, quietly; and she went on to make his coffee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over there came a hurried leave-taking.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander pulled on his riding-coat in great haste; drew on his gloves\\r\\n\\n\\nand then looked at Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well,” he muttered to himself, “she is henceforth only like my sister;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut I should embrace my sister before leaving her to go on a journey.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What are you saying, Alick dear?” inquired Drusilla, who caught the\\r\\n\\n\\nsound, but not the import of his words.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nothing. Good-bye, my little Drusa, my darling little Drusa,” he said,\\r\\n\\n\\nfolding her to his bosom and kissing her as no man ever kissed his\\r\\n\\n\\nsister yet, and as he had not kissed _her_ for many weeks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You do love me then, after all, don’t you, Alick?” she said, in\\r\\n\\n\\ndelight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Love you! I think I do, little darling! But now I must tear myself from\\r\\n\\n\\nyou, Drusa. You will find in my glass drawer a roll of bank-notes\\r\\n\\n\\namounting to between five and six hundred dollars, for your use while I\\r\\n\\n\\nam gone.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, I shall never want the tenth part in so short a time as a\\r\\n\\n\\nfortnight; and you are to be home in a fortnight, are you not, Alick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes, surely. Now then, good-bye!” he hastily exclaimed, giving her\\r\\n\\n\\nanother tight hug and long kiss.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You will write soon, Alick?” she said, following him to the front door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very soon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I shall want to write to you every day, beginning this evening.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhere shall I direct the first letter, Alick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To the post-office at Richmond.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then you will find one from me in Richmond the day after you get\\r\\n\\n\\nthere.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes, my darling! Thank you, pet! Good-bye! Good-bye! I have not an\\r\\n\\n\\ninstant to lose,” he hurriedly exclaimed, wringing her hand and jumping\\r\\n\\n\\ninto the carriage, upon which his luggage was already placed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo, who was in the driver’s seat, cracked his whip and started his\\r\\n\\n\\nhorses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla watched the carriage out of sight, and then turned sadly and\\r\\n\\n\\nwent into the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander drove rapidly to the town, and first to a hack stand, where he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad his luggage taken and put upon a hack. Then he sent Leo back to\\r\\n\\n\\nCedarwood with his carriage, and he himself got into the hack and drove\\r\\n\\n\\nto his uncle’s hotel, where he found the old gentleman impatiently\\r\\n\\n\\nwaiting for him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in an hour the whole family party had started on their voyage, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwere steaming down the Potomac on their way to Richmond, where early the\\r\\n\\n\\nnext morning they arrived safely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                             BRIGHT HOPES.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n             One precious pearl in sorrow’s cup\\r\\n\\n\\n               Unmelted at the bottom lay,\\r\\n\\n\\n             To shine again, when all drunk up\\r\\n\\n\\n               The bitterness should pass away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n             And that was hope, a fair sweet hope;\\r\\n\\n\\n               And oh, it woke such happy dreams,\\r\\n\\n\\n             And gave her soul such tempting scope\\r\\n\\n\\n               For all its dearest, fondest schemes.—MOORE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe loving little wife, the zealous little housekeeper, did not sit down\\r\\n\\n\\nin idleness and repining while her husband was absent. Occupation was\\r\\n\\n\\nalways her great resource against melancholy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was, besides, too much in sympathy with all nature not to feel the\\r\\n\\n\\ninfluence of the vitalizing spring season, with the reviving world\\r\\n\\n\\naround her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe sun was shining with a more genial splendor; the air was soft and\\r\\n\\n\\nwarm; the ground was quickening with the springing grass and the trees\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the rising sap and budding leaves. Birds were building their nests.\\r\\n\\n\\nAll things inspired thoughts of renovation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLittle Drusilla resolved to refresh her pretty wildwood home with a\\r\\n\\n\\nspring cleaning, so that it might possess new attractions for its truant\\r\\n\\n\\nmaster, when he should please to return.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNot that her house required this—for it was already as clean and sweet\\r\\n\\n\\nas it was possible for any dwelling to be; and the process to which she\\r\\n\\n\\nsubjected it was but the washing of what was already pure, and the\\r\\n\\n\\npolishing of what was already bright. But it was her maxim, as it had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen her mother’s before her, that things should not be permitted to\\r\\n\\n\\nbecome soiled before they were cleaned; but that they should be kept\\r\\n\\n\\nclean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the course of this work Drusilla opened the drawer of the\\r\\n\\n\\nlooking-glass in Alexander’s dressing-room, and while putting its\\r\\n\\n\\ncontents in order she found that little piece of paper which had\\r\\n\\n\\nproduced so strange an effect upon his feelings and actions. Thinking it\\r\\n\\n\\nto be only some little receipt, or memorandum, she opened it and read\\r\\n\\n\\nit.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIts effect upon her was very different from what it had been upon her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband. As she gathered its meaning her face softened with a sweet and\\r\\n\\n\\ntender smile, and she sat down in a chair to contemplate it at more\\r\\n\\n\\nleisure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I never saw this before; or any other of the sort. How it brings back\\r\\n\\n\\nthat day! that happy wedding-day! the happiest of my life! Dear Alick!\\r\\n\\n\\ndear, dear Alick, how blest you made me that day, in making me your own\\r\\n\\n\\nforever! forever and ever, my love! My joy seemed too much for earth,\\r\\n\\n\\ntoo much to be real. Even now, even now, I can scarcely realize how\\r\\n\\n\\nhappy I am and ought to be! Oh, my love! my love! I hope I may never\\r\\n\\n\\ngive you an uneasy moment as long as I live in this world! that I may\\r\\n\\n\\nnever cease to please and serve you all my days! Dear little token!” she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, fondly gazing on that fatal piece of paper—“I will keep you for\\r\\n\\n\\nhis sake. When I am sad and lonely I will look at you. I will cherish\\r\\n\\n\\nyou like my wedding-ring.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she went directly and made a little silk bag, put the paper in it,\\r\\n\\n\\nattached it to a ribbon, hung it around her neck and hid it in her\\r\\n\\n\\nbosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen smilingly she resumed her work.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen she considered the house thoroughly cleansed and worthy of its\\r\\n\\n\\nsummer hangings, she told Pina that crimson satin curtains should not be\\r\\n\\n\\nput up again until autumn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she ordered Leo to put the horses into the carriage to take her to\\r\\n\\n\\ntown.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was the first occasion upon which she had left home for many weeks.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she went now upon a shopping expedition, to purchase white lace\\r\\n\\n\\ncurtains for her windows, and white linen to make summer covers for her\\r\\n\\n\\ncrimson satin chair and sofa cushions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe spent the whole forenoon in making her selections; and then, feeling\\r\\n\\n\\ntired and hungry, she drove to a “Ladies’ Tea Room,” where she had once\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen with Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe entered and sat down at one of the little tables and asked for a cup\\r\\n\\n\\nof chocolate and some seed cakes, which were soon brought.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile she ate and drank she looked about her with the curiosity natural\\r\\n\\n\\nto one who had lately led so secluded a life. The room was half full of\\r\\n\\n\\ncustomers. At some of the tables small family parties of parents and\\r\\n\\n\\nchildren were gathered. At others ladies and gentlemen were seated. And\\r\\n\\n\\nat the table exactly opposite to her own there were two officers and two\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung women who were dining and drinking wine, laughing and talking, and\\r\\n\\n\\nconducting themselves generally in a manner not agreeable to quiet and\\r\\n\\n\\nwell-disposed people.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla glanced at this noisy party but once, and recognized the\\r\\n\\n\\nofficers as the same who had intruded into her box on the night she went\\r\\n\\n\\nto hear the German opera troupe. Chiefly because the party were so\\r\\n\\n\\nill-behaved, she was afraid to look towards them again. So she drew her\\r\\n\\n\\nveil around between the side of her face and her obnoxious neighbors,\\r\\n\\n\\nand she looked down into her plate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNatural as this action was, it caught the attention of the officers;\\r\\n\\n\\nand, innocent as it was, it gave umbrage to their female companions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She sees that we recognize her,” said one of the men.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd a low, derisive laugh came from one of the women.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nVery much abashed, and also a little alarmed, Drusilla left her luncheon\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf consumed and went to the counter to pay her bill.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut one of the officers got up and followed her, and, as she turned to\\r\\n\\n\\nleave the room, he placed himself before her, and, lifting his hat,\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How do you do, Miss?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla bowed in silence, and attempted to pass on.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Excuse me, but when did you reach town?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, sir; I have not the honor of your acquaintance,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Drusilla, coldly, passing him by and quickly leaving the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut he followed her out on the sidewalk, and joining her, said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You ‘have not the honor of my acquaintance,’ eh? Well, the ‘honor’ is\\r\\n\\n\\nquestionable, but the acquaintance is beyond a doubt, my dear! What!\\r\\n\\n\\ndon’t you remember the night I came into the box, to chaff my friend\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon on his pretty little acquisition, eh? By the way, how is Lyon?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBy this time Drusilla had beckoned her servant, who drove up with the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage, dismounted, opened the door, and let down the steps for his\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But you didn’t tell me how my friend Lyon is. I hope he is well. I know\\r\\n\\n\\nhe has left his rooms at the hotel. But if you will favor me with your\\r\\n\\n\\naddress, Miss—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo,” said Drusilla to her coachman, as she entered her carriage, “this\\r\\n\\n\\nperson annoys me. If you see a policeman give him in charge, and—drive\\r\\n\\n\\non.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, madam,” answered the man, heartily, cracking his whip and starting\\r\\n\\n\\nhis horses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the animals were not fresh, and they had not been fed or watered\\r\\n\\n\\nsince morning. So they did not move with their usual spirit. And\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla had not gone far up Seventh street road, on her way home,\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore she perceived that she was followed by a hack that was gaining\\r\\n\\n\\nupon her every moment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt first she supposed this following to be accidental; but when the hack\\r\\n\\n\\ndriving rapidly, caught up to her and might have passed her, yet did\\r\\n\\n\\nnot; but, on the contrary, slackened its pace and kept just behind her;\\r\\n\\n\\nshe suspected that there was something more than accident in the matter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd her suspicions were confirmed when she heard loud laughing and\\r\\n\\n\\ntalking in the hack, and recognized the voices of the disreputable party\\r\\n\\n\\nwho had insulted her in the tea room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe quickly let down the little window in front of her own carriage, and\\r\\n\\n\\nspoke to her coachman:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo—drive fast.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, which it is necessary so to do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who are those people behind, Leo?” she breathlessly inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A intoxified set, ma’am, which is unbeknown to me; being always too\\r\\n\\n\\nwell conducted to be acquainted with sich; which I think one of um is\\r\\n\\n\\nthe person you complained of, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes! go on quickly, for Heaven’s sake, Leo; let us leave them behind as\\r\\n\\n\\nsoon as possible,” hastily urged Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the young coachman put his jaded horses to their utmost speed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the horses in the hack were the fresher of the two sets, and they\\r\\n\\n\\nkept well up behind her carriage until they reached the gate of the\\r\\n\\n\\nprivate road leading through Cedarwood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere Leo drew up his carriage, left his seat, opened the gate, propped\\r\\n\\n\\nit back, and took the reins to lead his horses through.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey had but just cleared the gate, when Drusilla put her head from the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow and said, hastily:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo, stop just where you are! stop the way! Those persons are preparing\\r\\n\\n\\nto follow us in. Tell them that they can not be permitted to do so; that\\r\\n\\n\\nthis is a very private road leading to my own house, and no farther.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt the first word Leo had stopped the carriage, thus barring the way,\\r\\n\\n\\nand now he turned and spoke to the man who was the ringleader of the\\r\\n\\n\\nparty, and who had now left his seat and was mounted beside the driver\\r\\n\\n\\non the box.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir, this road leads to my mist’ess’s house and no\\r\\n\\n\\nfarther on,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, we know where it leads! We are going to make a call there!” laughed\\r\\n\\n\\nthe man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo, Leo, do not let them pass, whatever you do,” breathlessly\\r\\n\\n\\nwhispered Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, sir, if you please, my mist’ess don’t receive no strangers,”\\r\\n\\n\\nexpostulated the servant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, we are not strangers! We know her very well! And we know Lyon, too!\\r\\n\\n\\nCome, clear the way, my man, and let us pass.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, sir, my mist’ess don’t see no visitors of no sort, neither\\r\\n\\n\\nstrangers nor likewise acquaintances,” urged Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But she’ll see us!” laughed the man on the box. And his laugh was\\r\\n\\n\\nloudly echoed by his companions inside the hack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDuring this controversy Drusilla had sat back in her seat, keeping as\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch out of sight as possible, and only leaning forward when obliged to\\r\\n\\n\\nspeak to her servant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Leo had been artfully manœuvering his horses, with a purpose that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe party behind were too much confused by intoxication to detect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, my man, get out of the way, will you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes sir, immediate!” answered Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he suddenly wheeled round the carriage, clanged to the gate, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsecured it in the face of the baffled pursuers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen with a loud derisive laugh, the boy sprang up into his seat and\\r\\n\\n\\ndrove off through the woods towards home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe discomfited party in the hack sent after him a volley of oaths, that\\r\\n\\n\\nhe continued to hear until distance made them inaudible.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen they reached Cedarwood, Drusilla got out of her carriage more dead\\r\\n\\n\\nthan alive.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina met her and supported her into the house, while Leo gave a hasty\\r\\n\\n\\naccount of their adventure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Try to compose yourself, ma’am. Lor! I wouldn’t let myself be upset by\\r\\n\\n\\nthem rubbish!” said Pina as she held a glass of water to her mistress’s\\r\\n\\n\\nlips.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who were they, Leo, and why did they pursue me?” inquired Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen she was somewhat restored.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please, ma’am, I don’t know who they were, not being beknown to sich.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut they were all intoxified, the whole lot of ’em.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But why did they pursue me?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, ma’am, they was on a lark, and seen you was afeard of ’em.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There was more in it than that, Leo! Do you think they can get through\\r\\n\\n\\nthe gate?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, ma’am; I locked it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But they can get out of the carriage and climb over it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, ma’am, they’re too tipsy. They can hardly sit in their seats. The\\r\\n\\n\\ndriver is the onliest sober one in the lot, and he’ll take them away,\\r\\n\\n\\nyou may be sure, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what a horrible, what a revolting set! Oh, that such creatures\\r\\n\\n\\nshould live in this world!” exclaimed Drusilla, with a shudder. And she\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed to have forgotten all her pretty, new purchases in which she had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen so much interested.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut neither of her young servants had done so. And Pina, in haste to\\r\\n\\n\\nbring the treasures in that she might have a sight at them, and Leo in a\\r\\n\\n\\nhurry to get rid of them, that he might take his horses round to the\\r\\n\\n\\nstable, went out together.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina returned with her arms full of parcels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd soon Drusilla, who had laid off her bonnet, lost sight of her late\\r\\n\\n\\ndisagreeable adventure, in the pleasing occupation of displaying her\\r\\n\\n\\nbeautiful lace curtains to the admiring eyes of her handmaid.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor the next few days, mistress and maid were agreeably employed in\\r\\n\\n\\nmaking up the curtains, and in cutting and fitting the white linen chair\\r\\n\\n\\ncovers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd by Saturday evening the curtains were put up, and the chair covers\\r\\n\\n\\nput on, and the summer decoration of the pretty wild wood home was\\r\\n\\n\\ncomplete.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis brought the end of the first week of Alexander’s absence. Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nwas counting the days, and she knew that if he should keep his word, he\\r\\n\\n\\nwould be home by the end of another week.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe had written to him every evening, and sent the letter to the city\\r\\n\\n\\npost-office every morning by Leo, who was also instructed to inquire for\\r\\n\\n\\nletters for her. But as yet she had had but one from Alick, and that one\\r\\n\\n\\nonly announced his safe arrival at Richmond, and acknowledged the\\r\\n\\n\\nreceipt of her first note. Since that she had not heard from him. But\\r\\n\\n\\nshe said to herself that he was very much engaged, and could not be\\r\\n\\n\\nexpected to write to her more than once or twice a week. And so she\\r\\n\\n\\ncomforted her longing heart.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the two weeks of Alexander’s absence, Drusilla’s health improved very\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch. The reasons were obvious.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the first place, the very tender leave he had taken of her had\\r\\n\\n\\nrevived her fainting faith in his love, while the positive promise he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad made her to return within the fortnight had given her something\\r\\n\\n\\ncertain to anticipate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the second she no longer sat up night after night, watching, waiting\\r\\n\\n\\nand weeping, in fatigue, suspense, and even terror, that wore her nerves\\r\\n\\n\\nand wasted her strength and tried her temper. She went to bed early,\\r\\n\\n\\nslept soundly, and rose refreshed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in the third, she had made a discovery that filled her soul with\\r\\n\\n\\njoy. She knew now, for it was evident, even to her ignorance and\\r\\n\\n\\ninexperience, that she was to be blessed with the crowning blessing of\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman’s life, maternity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOnce again, on the Monday of the second week of her husband’s absence,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe made a shopping expedition into the city. And on this occasion she\\r\\n\\n\\nshut up the house and took both her servants along—Leo to drive the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage and Pina to sit inside with her. She took a luncheon basket\\r\\n\\n\\ntoo, that she might not be obliged to go into a refreshment room at the\\r\\n\\n\\nrisk of meeting her disagreeable acquaintances—although reason assured\\r\\n\\n\\nher that there was not one chance in a thousand of her seeing them under\\r\\n\\n\\nthe same circumstances again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis time Drusilla bought a quantity of fine flannel, linen, cambric,\\r\\n\\n\\nmuslin and lace, and also flaxen and silken floss and Berlin wool for\\r\\n\\n\\nembroideries.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Pina, who had guessed the sweet domestic mystery long before her\\r\\n\\n\\nchild-like mistress had suspected it, was as much interested in the\\r\\n\\n\\npurchase as their owner could be. Drusilla returned home without any\\r\\n\\n\\nunpleasant adventure. And the next day she commenced her delightful\\r\\n\\n\\ntask. And seated in her pleasant chamber, surrounded by her pretty\\r\\n\\n\\nworking materials, devising dainty little garments, and anticipating the\\r\\n\\n\\njoys in store for her, she felt happy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                              A SURPRISE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n               One struggle more and I am free\\r\\n\\n\\n                 From pangs that rend my heart in twain;\\r\\n\\n\\n               One long last sigh to love and thee,\\r\\n\\n\\n                 Then back to busy life again.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla received no second letter from Alexander. On the day after his\\r\\n\\n\\narrival in Richmond, he received and answered her first one. Then he\\r\\n\\n\\nwent with his uncle and cousin down to Old Lyon Hall, where he lived\\r\\n\\n\\nvery quietly with them for about ten days, all the party resting from\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir fashionable Washington campaign.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt the end of that time, in order to keep the letter of his promise to\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, he pleaded urgent business, and went up to Richmond, “for a\\r\\n\\n\\nday or two,” as he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn reaching that city, he hurried to the post-office, where he found\\r\\n\\n\\nnearly a dozen letters from Cedarwood awaiting him. He did not stop to\\r\\n\\n\\nanswer them; but took the first train to Washington, and arrived in the\\r\\n\\n\\ncapital the same afternoon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was plenty of time for him to have gone out to Cedarwood that\\r\\n\\n\\nevening. But, true to his plan of never sleeping under the same roof\\r\\n\\n\\nwith Drusilla again, if he could help it, he stayed at one of the city\\r\\n\\n\\nhotels all night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the morning, however, he hired a horse from a livery stable and set\\r\\n\\n\\nout to visit his home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThat day Drusilla had also risen very early, saying to herself:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This is the last day of the fortnight, and Alick will be home to-night.\\r\\n\\n\\nThat is to say, if nothing happens to prevent him—and surely there is\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing likely to happen—he will keep his pledged word with me and\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn to-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so she busied herself with affectionate preparations for his\\r\\n\\n\\narrival.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was nothing at all else that she could do to add to the\\r\\n\\n\\nattractions of the lovely home she had renovated and decorated for his\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfort and pleasure. But there were certain dainty dishes that always\\r\\n\\n\\ndelighted his epicurean taste; and these she had carefully prepared for\\r\\n\\n\\nhim.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen they were ready, she went up to her chamber and sat down to the\\r\\n\\n\\nliliputian dress-making that was now the sweetest task in the world to\\r\\n\\n\\nher.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was still early in the forenoon, being only ten o’clock, and she was\\r\\n\\n\\nintently engaged upon a miniature embroidered robe, when she heard the\\r\\n\\n\\nsound of horses’ feet approaching the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNot expecting that Alexander would return at this unusual hour of the\\r\\n\\n\\nday, or in this manner, and supposing that the noise arose from Leo\\r\\n\\n\\nexercising one of the horses from the stable, she paid no attention to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe matter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the next moment she heard the sound of a man’s footsteps on the\\r\\n\\n\\nstairs, and the instant after the door was thrown open and Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith a cry of joy, she sprang up to meet him and fell upon his bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why are you so glad to see me as all this comes to, my little Drusa?”\\r\\n\\n\\nhe asked, remorsefully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe could not answer him. In her excess of feeling, she could not speak.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut if he had come back from an absence of two years instead of two\\r\\n\\n\\nweeks, her delight and excitement could not have been greater.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe kissed and embraced her very fondly—“as I should if she were my\\r\\n\\n\\nsister,” perhaps he said to himself. And then with gentle force he put\\r\\n\\n\\nher back in her chair, and seated himself in another one near her, and\\r\\n\\n\\nput his arm around her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick dear, I’m so glad—so glad to see you!” she cried, as soon as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe recovered her voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So am I to see you, little darling, especially when I see you looking\\r\\n\\n\\nso well. How pretty you are; how much you have improved!” he said,\\r\\n\\n\\nrunning his fingers through her glossy tresses, and gazing admiringly\\r\\n\\n\\nupon her bright face, with its flushed cheeks, parted lips, and eyes\\r\\n\\n\\nsparkling through tears of joy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, I am so happy to have you back again!” she eagerly repeated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And yet it is very plain that you haven’t moped during my absence; have\\r\\n\\n\\nyou now, little one?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no indeed, Alick; I have been so cheerfully busy fixing up the\\r\\n\\n\\nplace against you should come. The house looks so fresh and pretty in\\r\\n\\n\\nits spring dress, Alick dear, I am sure you will enjoy it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not fresher or prettier than the house’s mistress, and I’m sure I shall\\r\\n\\n\\nlike both,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Shall you, Alick? Are you sure that I shall be able to please you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It will be my fault if you are not.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now that the winter is over and the summer at hand, it will be\\r\\n\\n\\npleasanter here in the country, Alick. And the grounds around this\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle place can be made very beautiful. Don’t you think so?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, little Drusa. And I intend to spare neither trouble nor expense in\\r\\n\\n\\nmaking this little estate a paradise for my peri. An ideal spot it shall\\r\\n\\n\\nbe; everything shall be arranged according to your taste. The woods,\\r\\n\\n\\nsince you love them, shall environ the ornamented grounds.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, dear! how good you are to me! But don’t sacrifice utility to\\r\\n\\n\\nbeauty for my sake, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Drusa! I would sacrifice a much greater thing for your sake,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, with a very deep sigh.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked up at him suddenly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are well, Alick? quite well, I hope?” were the next words she\\r\\n\\n\\naddressed to him, as she gazed anxiously in his care-worn face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not very well, little Drusa,” he answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd ah! who could be well with an evil conscience!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is—nothing serious, dear Alick?” she inquired, growing pale with\\r\\n\\n\\nfear for his health.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, little goose! only spring languor and the fatigue of my journey,”\\r\\n\\n\\nhe answered, with a laugh that reassured her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh; and perhaps you have not had breakfast,” she exclaimed, hastily\\r\\n\\n\\nrising.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I have,” he said, gayly, pushing her back in her seat. “I had\\r\\n\\n\\nbreakfast two hours ago. I don’t want that, nor do I want lunch yet, so\\r\\n\\n\\nyou need give yourself no trouble about me for awhile.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But would you like to go to your dressing-room? All is ready for you\\r\\n\\n\\nthere.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’ll warrant; but I made my toilet where I got my breakfast, so I need\\r\\n\\n\\nnot leave you even for that purpose.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Your luggage, Alick, have they brought it up?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have no luggage; I came out on horseback.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, was that your horse I heard?” she inquired in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; didn’t you know it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; I thought you came in a cab.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I preferred the saddle.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—how about your luggage, Alick dear? Shall I call Leo and order him\\r\\n\\n\\nto take the carriage and go after it? Where did you leave it? At the\\r\\n\\n\\nhotel where you breakfasted?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you inquisitive little imp! Sit down and be quiet while I tell you.\\r\\n\\n\\nI brought very little luggage to Washington, and that I left, as you\\r\\n\\n\\nsurmise, at the hotel where I breakfasted.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then let me send Leo for it. He can go and return in two hours,” she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, again starting up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What a little fidget you are, to be sure! There is not the least need\\r\\n\\n\\nto send for my things from the hotel. And if you did but know what a\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle time I have to spend with you, you would not be so eager to run\\r\\n\\n\\naway from me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThese words had the desired effect. They prepared her to hear his cruel\\r\\n\\n\\nannouncement. She dropped into her chair, and looking at him uneasily\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, dear, you are not going away again, are you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, my child; I shall be compelled to leave you again, and very soon.\\r\\n\\n\\nNow listen to me and be reasonable, my good little girl. I have kept my\\r\\n\\n\\nword and come back at the time I said I would. Have I not?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick,” she answered, in a low, meek voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, in order to keep my word with you, Drusa, I had to leave my\\r\\n\\n\\nbusiness and come off in a great hurry. Do you understand?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And the state in which I left my affairs makes it absolutely necessary\\r\\n\\n\\nfor me to go back to Richmond immediately.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick dear; but you will stay with me a day or two, at least?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; I came only to keep my word with you. I must go back this evening.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick!” she exclaimed in a tone full of grief, as she let her work\\r\\n\\n\\nfall from her hands and gazed at him with a look of despair that she\\r\\n\\n\\ncould not control.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, come, little Drusa, do be rational, little girl! See what an\\r\\n\\n\\neffort I have made to keep my word with you—dropping my most important\\r\\n\\n\\nbusiness at a critical juncture, just to come home and see you. Now,\\r\\n\\n\\nreally, I do everything in the world I can to please you,” he said, so\\r\\n\\n\\nearnestly that he almost persuaded even himself that he did.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, Alick, you do indeed; and you always have done so. What should\\r\\n\\n\\nI be, but for your loving kindness? A poor, desolate orphan, with no one\\r\\n\\n\\nto care for me! You are very good to me, Alick, and you always have been\\r\\n\\n\\nso; and I ought to be cheerful, as well as grateful, only I—cannot\\r\\n\\n\\nalways—and——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe could say no more; her voice broke into sobs, and she dropped her\\r\\n\\n\\nface upon her hands and wept.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Humph, this is the thanks I get for travelling several hundred miles\\r\\n\\n\\nexpress to see you. I have but a few hours to spend with you, and you\\r\\n\\n\\nentertain me with tears! Very encouraging to me to come again, I must\\r\\n\\n\\nsay!” he angrily exclaimed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe could not reply; her whole form was shaking with her convulsive\\r\\n\\n\\nsobs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe got up and walked about the room with his hands in his pockets, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwhistled an opera tune.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe tried hard to suppress her sobs and to command her voice, and when\\r\\n\\n\\nat length she succeeded in doing so, she held out her hands imploringly\\r\\n\\n\\ntowards him, and pleaded:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Forgive me, Alick. I could not help it, dear; indeed I could not. It\\r\\n\\n\\nwas because I loved you so. I love you so, Alick!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I wish to the Lord you didn’t love me ‘so!’ that’s all,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nbrutally exclaimed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick!” she said, still holding out her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is a cursed bore to be loved ‘so!’” he repeated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, you did not use to say so!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps I thought so, though! It’s an infernal nuisance to be loved so,\\r\\n\\n\\nI tell you, and I’m tired of it!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick, Alick, you used to make me tell you over and over again how much\\r\\n\\n\\nI loved you. You used to say I couldn’t love you too much, I couldn’t\\r\\n\\n\\neven love you enough,” she murmured, dropping her pleading hands upon\\r\\n\\n\\nher lap.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bosh! I must have been a great spoon in those days!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe did not reply to this, but again covered her face and wept softly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Besides,” continued this moral philosopher, “such love as yours is—what\\r\\n\\n\\ndo they call it in the prayer-books?—‘inordinate affection.’ And\\r\\n\\n\\ninordinate affection is very sinful, let me tell you, and will bring its\\r\\n\\n\\nown punishment. Sooner or later you will suffer for it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I have, I have suffered for it, have I not?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis wail came from her unawares, and the next moment she was sorry for\\r\\n\\n\\nhaving let it escape her, sorry for the feeling that prompted it; for\\r\\n\\n\\nshe could not bear even in her thoughts to blame one whom she worshipped\\r\\n\\n\\nso madly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, if you have suffered, it is your own fault.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know it, Alick—I know it; and I never meant to say that it was\\r\\n\\n\\nyours.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then what in this world is the matter with you? What do you need more\\r\\n\\n\\nthan you have? Of what do you complain?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Of nothing, Alick—I complain of nothing. I am out of my senses, I\\r\\n\\n\\nthink.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think so too. Here you are in a position that would be envied by\\r\\n\\n\\nhundreds—yes, by thousands, by millions of your sex, as the height of\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman’s happiness. You have a comfortable and even an elegant home; and\\r\\n\\n\\nI mean to settle it on you also. You have a luxurious table, a splendid\\r\\n\\n\\nwardrobe, attentive servants, horses, carriages—what in the world _can_\\r\\n\\n\\nyou want in addition to these?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Only a little more of my husband’s company, Alick,” she pathetically\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bosh! You are a Christian, or you profess to be one. You read your\\r\\n\\n\\nBible. Why don’t you go by it? St. Paul says, ‘Having food and raiment,\\r\\n\\n\\nbe therewith content,’ or words to that effect. You have not only food\\r\\n\\n\\nand raiment, but every comfort and luxury that money can buy. Why cannot\\r\\n\\n\\nyou be content?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, dear, ye! I have all _money_ can buy. But there are\\r\\n\\n\\nblessings that money cannot purchase. Oh, Alick, I could be content with\\r\\n\\n\\nvery much less of this world’s goods than your wealth has given me; I\\r\\n\\n\\ncould be happy with very little food and raiment, if only I had more of\\r\\n\\n\\nyour society.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was weeping softly, with her head bowed upon her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was still walking up and down the floor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently she got up and met him with her hands held out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do not leave me, Alick, dear—oh, do not leave again so soon. You have\\r\\n\\n\\nmade me your wife, and I have no life but in you—none, Alick, none! If\\r\\n\\n\\nyou tear me from your heart, I shall wither and die like a plant pulled\\r\\n\\n\\nup by the roots. Oh, take me to your bosom again, for I have no life out\\r\\n\\n\\nof you Alick—Alick—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was not in human nature, at least not in a young man’s nature, to\\r\\n\\n\\nresist her beauty, her pleading; and he folded her to his heart, covered\\r\\n\\n\\nher face with kisses, and then said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Little Drusa! little Drusa! oh, my dear, dear child! what a misery for\\r\\n\\n\\nyou that you should love me, wretch that I am!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But why, Alick? Why? It is my life—my very life! and I have no other!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Drusa! Drusa! Good Heaven! How is this to end! I wish from my soul\\r\\n\\n\\nyou had never had the misfortune of meeting me!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, why do you say that?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know!” he groaned. Then he answered evasively—“I am utterly\\r\\n\\n\\nunworthy of you. I cause you so much suffering.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But that comes of my weakness, not of your fault, dear Alick. Besides I\\r\\n\\n\\nam happy now, very happy now that I see you love me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Little Drusa, did you ever doubt that?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I never doubted your faith, Alick. When you have kept away from me, I\\r\\n\\n\\nhave doubted my own worthiness of your love.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My darling, if you were sure, entirely sure of my affection, could you\\r\\n\\n\\nthen bear that I should be absent from you a great deal?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No,” she answered, honestly; “I couldn’t even live, Alick. I couldn’t\\r\\n\\n\\nlive away from you, any more than a flower broken off.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, my soul! what will become of you, child? Better with your strong\\r\\n\\n\\naffections, better you had died in your infancy!” he muttered to\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is the matter, Alick? What are you saying?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am thinking of you. Poor child! With your nature you can never be\\r\\n\\n\\nhappy in this world.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes, I can, dear Alick! It takes so little to make me happy. Only\\r\\n\\n\\nlet me live with you and I ask no more of earth, or Heaven.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My darling, I do believe, I do believe, if all other things were\\r\\n\\n\\nconforming, you could also make me very happy,” he said gravely and\\r\\n\\n\\ntenderly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I should try so zealously to do it, Alick. I would never vex you with\\r\\n\\n\\nweeping or moping. Because you know I never did weep for anything but\\r\\n\\n\\nyour absence; and if I might be with you I should never have cause to\\r\\n\\n\\nweep again. If you must go back to Richmond, Alick, can’t you take me\\r\\n\\n\\nwith you? I could get ready in half an hour, or in less time. And I\\r\\n\\n\\nwouldn’t be troublesome to you on the journey, indeed I wouldn’t, dear.\\r\\n\\n\\nSay, will you take me?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My little Drusa, it is impossible. I should not be able to stop in\\r\\n\\n\\nRichmond over twenty-four hours. I should have to go into the country\\r\\n\\n\\nand travel from place to place, on this vexatious business. But don’t\\r\\n\\n\\nlook so despairing, darling! I will not stay a day longer than I can\\r\\n\\n\\nhelp,” he said, putting her gently from his arms, and throwing himself\\r\\n\\n\\ndown into a chair beside her work-table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe also resumed her seat. And she took up her needle-work.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What are you amusing yourself with, little Drusa? Dressing dolls?” he\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired, taking up and inspecting the little, embroidered robe that lay\\r\\n\\n\\nupon her lap. “Is this for a great doll!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Alick,” she answered, while a rosy blush and tender smile of joy\\r\\n\\n\\nand embarrassment brightened her face. “It is not for a great doll, it\\r\\n\\n\\nis for a little angel who is coming to us soon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The d—l!” exclaimed Alexander, invoking his master and guide.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe heard him and looked up hastily in surprise and pain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I thought you would be glad, Alick,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, hem, so I——If I’m not glad, it is for your sake, Drusa,” he said,\\r\\n\\n\\nconfusedly. Then, gathering more self-control, he added: “You are very\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung, little Drusa, to have the cares of maternity thrust upon you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Such sweet cares, Alick—not to be known from joys.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But you are scarcely sixteen years old!—too young, too young, Drusa.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But if I was old enough to be a wife, dear, I am old enough to be a\\r\\n\\n\\nmother.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are too young to be either, little Drusa.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You didn’t use to think so. Oh, Alick, I thought you would be glad. I\\r\\n\\n\\nam sorry you are not.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she folded her little robe up, and put it out of sight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It seems I cannot open my lips without wounding you, Drusa,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nmuttered, moodily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t say that, Alick. Come, let us go down. I want to show you how\\r\\n\\n\\npretty the drawing-room looks. And I want to show you the young birds—I\\r\\n\\n\\nmean the new broods of canaries, hatched since you left,” she said,\\r\\n\\n\\ncheerfully, rising.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                             GONE FOR GOOD.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n      One hurried kiss, one last, one long embrace,\\r\\n\\n\\n      One yearning look upon her tearful face.\\r\\n\\n\\n      And he was gone, and like a funeral knell\\r\\n\\n\\n      The winds still sighed—Beloved, fare thee well!—MRS. ESLING.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSuppressing all her mortification and sorrow at the cold reception her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband had given her sweet news, Drusilla took him through the\\r\\n\\n\\nrenovated house and showed him all its new improvements.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs if to make up for the previous surliness, he admired everything he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaw and praised his little housekeeper for her taste.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen he said he would go to the stable and look at the horses; and he\\r\\n\\n\\nasked her to get her bonnet and come with him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe ran up stairs, calling Pina to follow her. And while she was putting\\r\\n\\n\\non her thick shoes and her bonnet and mantle, she gave the girl\\r\\n\\n\\nparticular directions about the dinner. For as Mr. Lyon had so short a\\r\\n\\n\\ntime to stay, Drusilla did not wish to leave him long enough to pay a\\r\\n\\n\\nvisit to the kitchen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she went down stairs and joined her husband. And they walked\\r\\n\\n\\ntogether to the stable.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEverything there was found in a satisfactory condition and the horses\\r\\n\\n\\nwere in fine order. Evidently Leo had done his duty, as well as, or\\r\\n\\n\\nbetter than, so young a groom could be expected to do it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen Drusilla invited Alexander to walk through the ground, that she\\r\\n\\n\\nmight show him the new garden she had laid out. And, as before, he\\r\\n\\n\\nexpressed delight in all he saw, and approbation of her skill as a\\r\\n\\n\\nlandscape gardener.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You take so much pains to beautify this place, and find so much\\r\\n\\n\\npleasure in the task, that I hope you will be very happy here, little\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusa,” he said, as they turned to go back to the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall be very happy here, or anywhere else, dear Alick, when you have\\r\\n\\n\\ngot through that troublesome business and can come and stay at home with\\r\\n\\n\\nme,” she replied.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders, but made no answer. She did not see his\\r\\n\\n\\nquestionable gesture, so she continued:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“For indeed, Alick, you and I live now more like mere acquaintances than\\r\\n\\n\\nlike a married couple. And you seem less the master of the house than\\r\\n\\n\\nthe occasional guest of the mistress.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe laughed at this conceit, and then sighed as he replied:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t see how it can be helped, little Drusa. I wish it could be, in\\r\\n\\n\\nsome way. Heaven knows how it pains me to part with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Mr. Alick thought of Joe Smith and the Mormon Bible and wished that\\r\\n\\n\\none had been a true prophet and the other a divine revelation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, dear Alick, it is selfish in me, I know, but I am glad it pains you\\r\\n\\n\\nto part with me; and I hope it may hurt you so badly that you may not be\\r\\n\\n\\nable to stay away,” said Drusilla, with a sweet smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, little Drusa! however distressing it may be to me to absent myself\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom you, I must do so when duty requires the sacrifice,” sighed\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, piously. Then, to change the subject, he inquired—“You have\\r\\n\\n\\nseen nothing more of the face at the window, little Drusa?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, nothing at all. But then the windows, since you left, have always\\r\\n\\n\\nat nightfall been closed and curtained,” she answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nor heard anything of the man lurking about here?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, not a word.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nor gained any clue to his identity?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, none.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then you have not been annoyed by any such intrusion since I left you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, not by any.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very glad to hear it, little Drusa.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke she recollected the disorderly party who had followed her\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage from the city; and thought that truth required her to mention\\r\\n\\n\\nthe circumstance, so she added:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, yes. I didn’t write to you about it, because I knew it would\\r\\n\\n\\nonly make you anxious to no good purpose, and besides I only wished to\\r\\n\\n\\nwrite you good news——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What now, Drusa? What is it? What have you been keeping from me, it is\\r\\n\\n\\nvery wrong for you to keep any secret from me, let me tell you,”\\r\\n\\n\\nanxiously exclaimed Alexander, looking searchingly in her face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, it was no secret at all. It was only a little rudeness I was\\r\\n\\n\\nmade to bear.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Rudeness! From whom?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“From people who were scarcely responsible for their actions, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who were they? What rudeness did they offer you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You remember those officers that came into our box at the opera?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes—vagabonds! vulgar wretches! what about them?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“They saw me in at a Ladies’ Tea Room in the city, one day when I went\\r\\n\\n\\nshopping.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In a Ladies’ Tea Room! Drusilla, I am shocked that you should have gone\\r\\n\\n\\ninto such a place unattended. I am annoyed beyond measure that you\\r\\n\\n\\nshould have done so! No modest young woman, not to say lady, ever goes\\r\\n\\n\\nalone to such a place!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick dear, it was the very room you used to take me to, whenever you\\r\\n\\n\\ntook me to the city in the first days of our marriage. And I saw ladies\\r\\n\\n\\nthere and young ladies and little girls, and even babies and nurses—and\\r\\n\\n\\none always feels right and safe where there are babies, you know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; I don’t know it. And besides the ladies and children you speak of\\r\\n\\n\\nwere family parties; you went _alone;_ no wonder you were insulted.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhich of the villains insulted you—or did both?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Neither did, Alick dear. Please don’t be angry. One of the officers\\r\\n\\n\\ncame up and spoke to me, calling me ‘Miss’ and claiming my acquaintance.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut as you had not introduced him to me I would not know him.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And—then?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I left the Tea Room and got into the carriage and drove home.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And was that all?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; the two officers and the two women that were with them jumped into\\r\\n\\n\\na hack and followed me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ten thousand demons!—_Home?_” burst forth Mr. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah Alick dear, no; don’t be so violent. There was no harm done. I\\r\\n\\n\\nwouldn’t even have mentioned the matter, only you asked me a question\\r\\n\\n\\nthat I was bound to answer truthfully,” pleaded the gentle creature.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How far did they follow you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Only to the gate of the road leading through the woods to our house—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To our—” Here Alexander burst into an explosion of oaths and expletives\\r\\n\\n\\nthat caused his wife to shudder with horror.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, Alick, don’t, dear! don’t! It is a sin! Oh, Alick, hush! You\\r\\n\\n\\nfrighten me so!” she pleaded almost breathlessly, clinging to his arm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If I catch one of those villains I will blow his brains out. If I\\r\\n\\n\\ndon’t, may the—” And here Alexander sealed his oath by invoking a\\r\\n\\n\\nterrible imprecation on his own soul if he failed to keep it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, my love, my dear, don’t, don’t. Heaven will never forgive you!”\\r\\n\\n\\nwept Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stop whimpering, you provoking little fool, and tell me. Did they\\r\\n\\n\\nattempt to follow you through the gate?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick, but they couldn’t do it, because Leo closed it and locked\\r\\n\\n\\nit—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh! let me only lay my eyes on them—that is all! If they get off with\\r\\n\\n\\nlife may I be——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Hsh-sh!_ Oh, Alick, dear, this is awful!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hold your tongue, and take your hand from my lips! And now, if you can\\r\\n\\n\\nspeak to some purpose, do so! How long was this ago that they dared to\\r\\n\\n\\npursue you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“About nine days since, Alick. But they scarcely knew what they were\\r\\n\\n\\nabout. Indeed they did not, Alick love!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Have they troubled you since?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, not once. I have neither seen nor heard of them since, nor has any\\r\\n\\n\\none else annoyed me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is well so far. But now I am convinced that one of those villains\\r\\n\\n\\nwas identical with the spy who frightened you by looking through the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow. I wish I had not to hurry back to Richmond to-night. If I could\\r\\n\\n\\nonly remain in the city one day, I might settle accounts with these\\r\\n\\n\\ngentlemen!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, then for the first time I am—what I never thought I should\\r\\n\\n\\nbe—glad that you are going away so soon! Ah, my own dear husband,\\r\\n\\n\\nabsence is bitter, but not so bitter as sin and its consequences! Oh, my\\r\\n\\n\\ndear, dear Alick, I shall pray day and night that Heaven may keep you\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom blood guiltiness.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBy this time they had reached the house, which they soon entered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Alick did not get over his fit of fury until some hours later, when\\r\\n\\n\\ndinner was served and he had eaten a hearty meal, and drank several\\r\\n\\n\\nglasses of fine wine, and was luxuriating in the sedative vapors of a\\r\\n\\n\\nreal Havana.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe fragrant fumes of the good cigar did not drive Drusilla away. She\\r\\n\\n\\nsat near him with a little piece of crochet work in her fingers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I want you to promise me one thing, Drusa,” said Alick, taking the weed\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom his lips.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will promise you anything in the world,” she answered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I dare say! But would you perform it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you could.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, of course that is understood! Providence permitting, I will do\\r\\n\\n\\nwhatever you wish.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, the promises I wish you to make me will not be very hard to keep.\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the first place, I want you to give me your word that you will not go\\r\\n\\n\\ninto Washington unless in case of necessity.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have my word for that, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And when obliged to go, that you will show yourself as little as\\r\\n\\n\\npossible; that you will never recognize or speak with any acquaintance,\\r\\n\\n\\nold or new, whom you may happen to meet.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I give you my word for these also, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And that you will never under any circumstances whatever, or to any\\r\\n\\n\\nperson whoever, give your name or address, or mine.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Take my word for that, too. I promise—solemnly promise to remember and\\r\\n\\n\\nobey all your directions, Alick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is right,” he said. And he resumed his cigar, and smoked in\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfort for some minutes, and then threw away the stump, and got up,\\r\\n\\n\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I must see about going.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick! So soon, dear!” she exclaimed, in dismay.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So soon? Why, it is seven o’clock now, and the boat leaves at nine. I\\r\\n\\n\\nhave but two hours to get it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo can drive you there easily in one hour, Alick. The horses are quite\\r\\n\\n\\nfresh, and will go like the wind. And besides, I want you to take tea\\r\\n\\n\\nwith me before you leave,” she said, touching the bell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I can take a cup of tea while Leo is putting the horses to the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage, I suppose,” he admitted, resuming his seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina came in to answer the bell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla told her to set the table for tea. And Mr. Lyon directed her to\\r\\n\\n\\ntell Leo to put the horses to the carriage and bring it around to the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor, and to get himself ready to drive to town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina went out to obey both her orders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You will not be long absent this time, will you, Alick?” inquired\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do not know, Drusa; but not a day longer than is necessary,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nevasively replied.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—can’t you give me some little idea, Alick, just to comfort me while\\r\\n\\n\\nyou are away? Will you be gone a week, ten days, a fortnight—or how long\\r\\n\\n\\ndo you think, dear Alick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, Drusa, my child, you must not seek to bind me by any promise to\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn at any fixed time. See how it has inconvenienced me on this\\r\\n\\n\\noccasion, and without giving you much gratification either. Here,\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause I felt bound by the promise I had given you, I was compelled to\\r\\n\\n\\ndrop my business at a most important crisis, and hurry on here just to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee you for a few hours, and then hurry back. If you had not bound me by\\r\\n\\n\\nthat promise, I _might_ possibly, by staying a few days longer in\\r\\n\\n\\nRichmond, and putting my business in a better state of progress, have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen enabled to come and stay longer with you. But as it is, I must be\\r\\n\\n\\noff at once. So you see the evil of binding a man to any fixed time.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Alick. I don’t wish to bind you to anything, dear. I will only\\r\\n\\n\\ntrust that you will come back to me as soon as you can,” she meekly\\r\\n\\n\\nreplied.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As soon as it shall be proper to do so, I will come back,” he answered\\r\\n\\n\\nevasively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina came in and set the table, and brought in the tea service and\\r\\n\\n\\narranged it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey—the faithful wife and faithless husband sat down together for the\\r\\n\\n\\nlast time at that table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe filled his cup and handed it to him, and urged upon him the delicate\\r\\n\\n\\ndainties that she had prepared for him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Alick, whose appetite seldom suffered under any circumstances,\\r\\n\\n\\nenjoyed the luxuries of the tea-table as much as if he had not dined\\r\\n\\n\\nsumptuously a few hours previous.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut as soon as he heard the carriage approaching the door, he got up,\\r\\n\\n\\nwent into the hall, followed by Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere he put on his overcoat and gloves, snatched his wife to his bosom\\r\\n\\n\\nfor one hasty embrace and adieu; then took his hat, ran out of the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse, jumped into the carriage, and ordered the coachman to drive fast\\r\\n\\n\\ntowards town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe carriage started.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd this time Alexander was gone for good.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXXV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                            CRUEL TREACHERY.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n             And be these juggling fiends no more believed,\\r\\n\\n\\n             That palter with us in a double sense;\\r\\n\\n\\n             That keep the word of promise to the ear\\r\\n\\n\\n             And break it to the hope.—SHAKSPEARE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander had come and gone like a dream. And, in truth, his flying\\r\\n\\n\\nvisit had given his young wife little comfort. He had spent more than\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf the few hours he had passed at home in grumbling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs usual, she could not find it in her heart to blame him. To keep up\\r\\n\\n\\nher spirits, she set about putting in order her little house that had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen somewhat disarranged by his sudden arrival and departure. In the\\r\\n\\n\\nwords of another wronged woman, she was “resigned, but not happy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer days passed quietly, if not cheerfully. She occupied herself with\\r\\n\\n\\nher small household affairs; with making up the pretty liliputian\\r\\n\\n\\nwardrobe upon which she was engaged; with taking care of her birds; and\\r\\n\\n\\nwith gardening, walking and riding during the day.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe spent her evenings in reading and writing, or singing and playing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was comforted with three sweet hopes: the first was for his letters,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe second his return, and the third the arrival of the little stranger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe arose with the earliest dawn of day, and she retired early in the\\r\\n\\n\\nevening, and so her health continued to improve.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut day succeeded day, until a week had passed away, and still she\\r\\n\\n\\nreceived no letter from her absent husband. Then she grew weary and sad.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe truth is that Alexander, with a false mercy in keeping with his\\r\\n\\n\\nfalse course at this time, was putting into practice his sapient plan of\\r\\n\\n\\n“breaking with her gradually,” which was just distilling to her, drop by\\r\\n\\n\\ndrop, the bitterness of “despised love;” inflicting on her the\\r\\n\\n\\nintolerable torture of a slow heart-breaking.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter ten days had gone by she received a note from him; it was short,\\r\\n\\n\\ncool and dry. He said that he had reached Richmond in safety, but had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen too busy to write before; that he was well and hoped she was; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he remained her affectionate—“A.” There were not half a dozen lines\\r\\n\\n\\nin the whole letter, and Drusilla thought the writing did not look like\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander’s hand. But she read it over and over again, and her tears\\r\\n\\n\\ndropped slowly down upon it as she murmured:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Too busy to write’ to me—‘too busy to write.’ Oh, Alick, dear, what\\r\\n\\n\\nsort of business would it be that could keep me from writing to you for\\r\\n\\n\\nten whole days? But, then, I am a woman and you are a man, and that\\r\\n\\n\\nmakes all the difference, I suppose. But, oh, my heart is so weak—so\\r\\n\\n\\nweak, my Heavenly Father!” she cried, suddenly, in her sorrow, appealing\\r\\n\\n\\nto the All Compassionate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then again she betook herself to work as an antidote to despair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter this a heart-sickening month of silence passed away, in which she\\r\\n\\n\\nheard no word from him. And then she got a second note, dated from some\\r\\n\\n\\ndistant village in New England, from which he wrote to tell her that he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad been travelling for the last four weeks, and he was travelling still\\r\\n\\n\\nupon that business growing out of his father’s will; that it would be\\r\\n\\n\\nuseless for her to write to him, as he was continually moving rapidly\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom place to place, and could not wait to receive her letters. His\\r\\n\\n\\nhealth continued good, and he hoped that hers did. And he was ever her\\r\\n\\n\\nfriend—“A.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis letter filled less than half a page, and the writing was even less\\r\\n\\n\\nlike Alexander’s than that of the other one had been. And Drusilla wept\\r\\n\\n\\nbitterly over it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If I were not his wife, I should think he was deserting me by degrees,”\\r\\n\\n\\nshe sobbed, hitting at last the very truth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn addition to all her other causes of distress, she had the bitterness\\r\\n\\n\\nof knowing that he had not waited to get one of the affectionate daily\\r\\n\\n\\nletters she had directed to him at Richmond; that they were all wasted,\\r\\n\\n\\nlike her love, because he had not even taken the trouble to tell her\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he was going to travel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd now one word about Alexander’s duplicity, which he called\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscretion. (If people could be got to call crimes by their right names,\\r\\n\\n\\nperhaps they would not commit them.) When Alexander was at home, having\\r\\n\\n\\naccess to all Drusilla’s boxes, he secretly got possession of all the\\r\\n\\n\\nletters he had ever written to her and he destroyed them. His first\\r\\n\\n\\nsubsequent letter was written from Richmond, to which he had come with\\r\\n\\n\\nhis uncle and cousin for a sojourn of a few days previous to setting out\\r\\n\\n\\nwith them on a tour of pleasure. His second one was from a hamlet in the\\r\\n\\n\\nGreen Mountains, where he was staying with the General and Miss Anna, in\\r\\n\\n\\nthese first warm days of July. Both letters were written in a disguised\\r\\n\\n\\nhand, and signed only with his initial, lest they should ever be brought\\r\\n\\n\\nup against him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSome suspicion of his bad faith was forcing its way even into the\\r\\n\\n\\nconfiding bosom of his wife. But the heart-wasting weariness of the next\\r\\n\\n\\nfew weeks, who can tell? To keep her heart from breaking, she kept\\r\\n\\n\\nsteadily at work. Ah, work! How great is the love of our Heavenly Father\\r\\n\\n\\nin commuting the very curse laid upon man at his fall into blessings; in\\r\\n\\n\\ninfusing into the very punishment of his sins consolation for his\\r\\n\\n\\nsuffering. For surely, in addition to its creative and productive force,\\r\\n\\n\\nwork has consoling power, since, next after religion, it is to the\\r\\n\\n\\ndesolate and wearyhearted the greatest comfort on earth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla found it so; for, if occupation did not give her happiness, it\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainty kept her from despair. The months rolled slowly on. One of the\\r\\n\\n\\nmost distressing elements in her misery was the fact she could not even\\r\\n\\n\\nwrite to her husband, not knowing where to direct her letters; and this\\r\\n\\n\\nwas farther embittered by the knowledge that he himself had cut off all\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch communication between them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStill she continued to send Leo daily to the post-office in the hope of\\r\\n\\n\\ngetting a letter from him; but week after week wore away without\\r\\n\\n\\nbringing news of Alexander.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the hope of hearing of him, if she could not hear from him, she wrote\\r\\n\\n\\nand ordered the principal daily papers from all the great cities in the\\r\\n\\n\\nnorth. And huge was the bundle that Leo brought every day from the news\\r\\n\\n\\nagent in Washington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when she was disappointed in getting a letter, as she was always\\r\\n\\n\\nsure to be, she would, with a morbid eagerness, carefully con over the\\r\\n\\n\\nnames in the list of arrivals at the various hotels in all the cities,\\r\\n\\n\\nin the faint hope of seeing his name in some one of them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut this was worse than “hunting for a needle in a haystack,” for it was\\r\\n\\n\\nhunting for what was lost somewhere else.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSometimes in fear and trembling she would even look over the deaths and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe casualties, in the dread of seeing his name among the victims. But\\r\\n\\n\\nshe never saw it anywhere. We could have told her, “Naught is never in\\r\\n\\n\\ndanger.” If she did not see the name of her truant husband, she saw\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething else that startled her, and it was this:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n  NEXT OF KIN.—If the heirs of the late Reverend Malcomb Sterling should\\r\\n\\n\\n  see this advertisement they will please to communicate immediately\\r\\n\\n\\n  with the undersigned, from whom they will hear something to their\\r\\n\\n\\n  advantage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                                                   KENT & HENEAGE,\\r\\n\\n\\n                                   Solicitors, 33 Bar street, Baltimore.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla stared at this notice in astonishment. And then she read it\\r\\n\\n\\nover again two or three times. _She_ was the only living representative\\r\\n\\n\\nof the late Malcomb Sterling. Her father’s last pastoral charge had been\\r\\n\\n\\nin Baltimore. This advertisement appeared in a Baltimore paper, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nfirm to be communicated with were Baltimore lawyers. Clearly the notice\\r\\n\\n\\noriginated with some one who had taken pains to trace her poor father’s\\r\\n\\n\\nlast abiding place, in order to advertise there for his heirs. It must,\\r\\n\\n\\ntherefore, be of considerable importance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer first impulse was to cut out the piece and enclose it in a letter to\\r\\n\\n\\nher husband, that he might deal with it as he should deem proper. But\\r\\n\\n\\nthen she instantly recollected that she was ignorant of Mr. Lyon’s\\r\\n\\n\\naddress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter a little reflection she concluded that it was her own duty to\\r\\n\\n\\ncommunicate with the advertising parties.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo she sat down and wrote to the firm of Kent & Heneage, and told them\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she was the only child of the late Reverend Malcomb Sterling, by\\r\\n\\n\\nhis wife Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe sent off this letter; and soon forgot all about the matter in her\\r\\n\\n\\nall-engrossing anxiety to hear from her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs before, she every day sent Leo to the post office, with orders if he\\r\\n\\n\\nshould find a letter by the first mail to hasten home with it\\r\\n\\n\\nimmediately; if not, to wait for the second mail.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn a fresh and brilliant morning of the third day after she had written\\r\\n\\n\\nto the lawyers, Drusilla was at work in her flower-garden, when she saw\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo galloping toward the house, and holding out at arm’s length a\\r\\n\\n\\nletter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe face of the boy, who had seen and understood his mistress’s daily\\r\\n\\n\\ndisappointment, was beaming with delight, as he drew rein before her,\\r\\n\\n\\nsprang from his saddle, and handed her the letter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe seized it eagerly, believing it to be from her husband, and\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed in her joy:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, thank you, Leo! At last—at last! Oh, I’m so glad!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“’Deed, so am I, ma’am—glad as if I’d had a fortin left me,” answered\\r\\n\\n\\nthe boy, showing in every tone and look as much sympathy as he could\\r\\n\\n\\ncombine with very much respect, “which it is from master, ma’am, and I\\r\\n\\n\\nhope he is well?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the little lady’s face had fallen. The letter was not from her\\r\\n\\n\\nbeloved husband, announcing his speedy arrival. It was only from the\\r\\n\\n\\nfirm of Kent & Heneage, and it _only_ informed her of her inheritance of\\r\\n\\n\\na vast estate, by the decease of a bachelor great-uncle, who was a\\r\\n\\n\\nmerchant of San Francisco with a corresponding house in Baltimore, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwho had recently died intestate in the first mentioned city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis news would have made some women very happy. But not Drusilla. The\\r\\n\\n\\nreaction with her was great. Tears of disappointment swelled her\\r\\n\\n\\neyelids, and dropped upon the open page.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo, who was watching her in reverential interest, seeing her tears, now\\r\\n\\n\\nspoke:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope nothing is amiss with master, ma’am!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No—I don’t know. Oh, Leo! it is not from your master; it is nothing but\\r\\n\\n\\na mere business letter from a lawyer!” said the little lady, with a\\r\\n\\n\\nsigh.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is that all, ma’am?” responded the boy in a disappointed tone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All, Leo,” his mistress answered, as she turned sadly towards the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe did not care a farthing for the death or the inheritance of the old\\r\\n\\n\\nbachelor uncle, of whom she had not heard mention made more than three\\r\\n\\n\\ntimes in her life, and who, while he was rolling in wealth, had left her\\r\\n\\n\\ndying father, her mother and herself to suffer the bitterest pains of\\r\\n\\n\\npoverty.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe neglected to answer the lawyer’s letter, and gave herself up to\\r\\n\\n\\ngrief and anxiety about her careless but still beloved husband, until a\\r\\n\\n\\nweek had passed away, when she received another, and a very urgent\\r\\n\\n\\nletter from Messrs. Kent & Heneage, asking to hear from her by return\\r\\n\\n\\nmail.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis one she immediately answered. And this was the beginning of a long\\r\\n\\n\\nepistolary correspondence between Drusilla and Kent & Heneage of\\r\\n\\n\\nBaltimore, and Speight & Wright of San Francisco. In the course of this\\r\\n\\n\\ncorrespondence the heiress learned that both those legal firms had been\\r\\n\\n\\nthe solicitors of her uncle, the millionaire, and that the first had\\r\\n\\n\\nmanaged his business in Baltimore, and the last in San Francisco; that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe whole estate, comprising the property in both cities, was estimated\\r\\n\\n\\nat three millions of dollars, and consisted in warehouses, shipping\\r\\n\\n\\ngoods, and bank stock. But she was also advised that she would be\\r\\n\\n\\nrequired to prove her identity, and establish every link in the chain of\\r\\n\\n\\nevidence that connected her with her uncle before she could take\\r\\n\\n\\npossession of the property. And Messrs. Kent & Heneage tendered her the\\r\\n\\n\\nhelp of all their legal skill, learning and experience, in establishing\\r\\n\\n\\nher claims.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYoung as she was, Drusilla saw at once that there would be no difficulty\\r\\n\\n\\nin proving herself the lawful heiress of the deceased Crœsus. So she\\r\\n\\n\\nwrote to the lawyers that the genealogical line to be traced was very\\r\\n\\n\\nplain, short and straight; that every point in its progress could be\\r\\n\\n\\nproved by church registers, court records, private letters, and personal\\r\\n\\n\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen the firm wrote to her requesting a personal interview, and offering\\r\\n\\n\\neither to receive her at their office in Baltimore, or to visit her at\\r\\n\\n\\nher own home in Washington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd here arose Drusilla’s first difficulty. She had dated her letters,\\r\\n\\n\\nnot from Cedarwood, but simply from Washington City, and though she had\\r\\n\\n\\nsigned them Drusilla Sterling Lyon, she had not said one word about her\\r\\n\\n\\nstate as a married woman, thus unconsciously leaving it to be assumed\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she was a widow, acting upon her own responsibility. She could not\\r\\n\\n\\nwrite of her marriage, because it had been her husband’s will that it\\r\\n\\n\\nshould be kept secret from all but the faithful servants who were in\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir confidence. And for this cause, also, she could neither visit the\\r\\n\\n\\nlawyers at their office, nor receive them at her house. She was puzzled\\r\\n\\n\\nhow to act.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick, Alick, dear,” she sighed, as she read over again the\\r\\n\\n\\nlawyer’s letter; “Oh, Alick, darling, how your long absence and this\\r\\n\\n\\nforced secrecy does constantly compromise me. I find myself in a cruelly\\r\\n\\n\\nfalse position. What shall I do now? Wait till I see you before I take\\r\\n\\n\\nanother step in this matter? That is what I must do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she sat down and wrote to Messrs. Kent & Heneage, telling them that\\r\\n\\n\\nit was not just at present convenient for her to leave home, or to\\r\\n\\n\\nreceive visitors, but that she hoped it might be so in a few weeks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And this looks very like a subterfuge,” she said to herself as she\\r\\n\\n\\nrevised her own lines. “And what will they think of me for putting them\\r\\n\\n\\noff in this foolish way? Think me an impostor as likely as not. And who\\r\\n\\n\\ncan wonder if they do? Oh, Alick! Alick!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe sent her letter off, and for a week or ten days, she heard no more\\r\\n\\n\\nof her legal friends. This correspondence, embarrassing as it was to\\r\\n\\n\\nher, and difficult as it was for her to manage, upon account of her\\r\\n\\n\\nfalse position as a secretly wedded wife, had nevertheless done her\\r\\n\\n\\ngood, in distracting her thoughts from the intense grief and anxiety she\\r\\n\\n\\nhad suffered from the long absence and total silence of her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, the summer wore wearily away. On the first of September, she\\r\\n\\n\\nreceived another letter from her new legal acquaintances, praying her no\\r\\n\\n\\nlonger to neglect so important a manner as the establishment of her\\r\\n\\n\\nclaims to the heirship of the great Sterling property.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAmid painful feelings of shame that she might not speak out plainly,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she must be secretive and seem deceitful, she penned a reply,\\r\\n\\n\\nasking the lawyer’s pardon for having appeared neglectful; beseeching\\r\\n\\n\\nthem yet to have a little patience with her; telling them that\\r\\n\\n\\ncircumstances which she could not at present command, precluded her from\\r\\n\\n\\nproceeding farther in this matter; but expressing an earnest hope that\\r\\n\\n\\nin a short time she might be able to do so. She begged to assure them\\r\\n\\n\\nthat as she was truly the lawful heiress of her deceased uncle, Charles\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling, being the only surviving descendant of his only brother, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhe having left no other kindred, so her claim to the estate could not\\r\\n\\n\\nfail to be established; and that when it should be, she begged them to\\r\\n\\n\\nbelieve, that they should find that their time and labor, and kind\\r\\n\\n\\ninterest in her affairs, had not been thrown away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was a simple, earnest truthfulness and good feeling in this other\\r\\n\\n\\nmystifying letter, that must have carried conviction of the writer’s\\r\\n\\n\\ngood faith even to the unbelieving legal mind. For within three days,\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla received an answer from the firm, saying that they regretted\\r\\n\\n\\nthe delay upon her own account, but would wait her pleasure and\\r\\n\\n\\nconvenience.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so this correspondence ceased for the time being.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSeptember passed slowly away, without bringing any letter from Mr. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd oh, in what weariness, heaviness, sorrow and soreness of heart, it\\r\\n\\n\\npassed with the young neglected wife, who can describe, or even imagine?\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was almost dying of hope deferred. A fatal suspicion of her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband’s falsehood was slowly, but surely, eating its way into her\\r\\n\\n\\nheart and life. And still the bitterest element in her sorrow was the\\r\\n\\n\\nfact that she could make no appeal to any remaining tenderness he might\\r\\n\\n\\nhave for her, not even knowing where to write to him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOctober came, and then,—\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n            “When hope was coldest, and despair most deep,”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\na letter arrived from Alexander. She was that evening sitting and\\r\\n\\n\\nshivering, not from cold, but from nervousness, over a bright little\\r\\n\\n\\nfire in her dressing-room, when Pina ran in, without the ceremony of\\r\\n\\n\\nrapping, and exclaimed, breathlessly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It’s Leo, ma’am, which he’s just brung a letter from the post-office,\\r\\n\\n\\nas he says must be from master, because it’s got Richmond printed onto\\r\\n\\n\\nit, and he can read print, though not writing. And he says how he’ll\\r\\n\\n\\nbring the letter in and put it into your hands himself, and here he is—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore Pina had finished half her speech, Drusilla had jumped up and run\\r\\n\\n\\nto meet Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he entered the room, with his face beaming with pleasure, she\\r\\n\\n\\nsnatched the letter from his grasp, tore it open and devoured its\\r\\n\\n\\ncontents.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh! poor child! little comfort that long-looked for letter brought her.\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was shorter, drier and colder than any that had gone before it.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander vouchsafed not one word of excuse for his long silence. He\\r\\n\\n\\nannounced his arrival at Richmond; and told her that he could not with\\r\\n\\n\\npropriety pay her a visit that autumn, for reasons that he would explain\\r\\n\\n\\nto her in a subsequent letter; he hoped that she was in as good health\\r\\n\\n\\nand spirits as he begged to assure her that he himself was; and he\\r\\n\\n\\nsubscribed himself her friend and well-wisher, “A.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla dropped the letter, and burst into a passion of sobs and tears,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat much alarmed her loving servants.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey thought no less than that their master had met with a fatal\\r\\n\\n\\naccident, or was smitten with a deathly disorder, if he was not already\\r\\n\\n\\ndead and buried.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey tried to help and comfort her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo went and brought her a glass of ice-water.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina poured some Florida water upon a handkerchief and offered her,\\r\\n\\n\\nsaying caressingly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, mist’ess, dear, don’t take on so. It’s the Lord’s will, you know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is NOT, Pina! The sin of man is NOT the will of God!” passionately\\r\\n\\n\\nbroke forth the long-suffering soul.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, mist’ess, dear, ’scuse me. I didn’t know ’twas sin. I thought ’twas\\r\\n\\n\\nonly sickness, or something.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I—hush!—I spoke hastily—I spoke without thinking. There, Pina, that\\r\\n\\n\\nwill do. Thank you, child. Go, leave me now; I am better by myself; _do_\\r\\n\\n\\ngo. Leo, take her away,” with difficulty gasped Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when she had got her servants out of the room and bolted the door,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe threw herself into her chair and gave free vent to the suppressed\\r\\n\\n\\nsobs and tears that had been nearly choking her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what a letter to write me! After such a long and cruel silence too!\\r\\n\\n\\nCannot pay me a visit this autumn! ‘_Pay me a visit!_’ What does he mean\\r\\n\\n\\nby that? This is his home and I am his wife. And he signs himself my\\r\\n\\n\\nfriend and well-wisher. ‘_Friend and well-wisher!_’ And no more than\\r\\n\\n\\nthat? Why he is my husband! Oh, _what_ does he mean by this cruel\\r\\n\\n\\nletter?” she cried, with streaming eyes and heaving breast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she drew from her bosom the small black silk bag, took from it the\\r\\n\\n\\npiece of paper of which mention has already made, read it through her\\r\\n\\n\\ntear-dimmed eyes, then kissed and replaced it, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If it was not for this precious little document, I should think he\\r\\n\\n\\nmeant to abandon me. I should fear that I was not his wife. I should\\r\\n\\n\\nfear I had been fooled by a false marriage. But this bit of paper proves\\r\\n\\n\\nthat I am truly his lawful wife—though he treats me more like a—Ah,\\r\\n\\n\\nHeaven forgive him! I am very glad I found this little document. It\\r\\n\\n\\nreassures me when I doubt. And this great grief so clouds my mind that I\\r\\n\\n\\nsuppose I can’t help doubting, even when such doubt is mere madness. But\\r\\n\\n\\nI have the paper, and ‘seeing is believing,’” she sighed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh! how little the poor young creature knew that the document upon which\\r\\n\\n\\nshe founded her faith in the indissoluble legality of her marriage was\\r\\n\\n\\nthe very same upon which Alexander Lyon, her husband, based his belief\\r\\n\\n\\nin his freedom from matrimonial bonds.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut this is a mystery.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs soon as she had recovered some degree of composure, she availed\\r\\n\\n\\nherself of her knowledge of his address to write to him the first letter\\r\\n\\n\\nshe had been able to send him in some months. In this letter so entirely\\r\\n\\n\\nwas she taken up by her love and her sorrow, that she utterly forgot to\\r\\n\\n\\nmention the enormous fortune that had been left her. She wrote him a\\r\\n\\n\\nlong, earnest, impassioned appeal, praying him by the love he once bore\\r\\n\\n\\nher, and by the love that she must ever bear him, since it was the life\\r\\n\\n\\nof her life, to come to her, if only for a little while; she said,\\r\\n\\n\\npathetically, that she would never ask it again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, these words are cold and lifeless,” she wrote. “But if you were\\r\\n\\n\\nhere, my soul would find some means of reaching yours. My lips and my\\r\\n\\n\\neyes and my hands would show you that they only live when they meet\\r\\n\\n\\nyours. Oh, come home! I die, Alick! I die! Come and save me! Come, if\\r\\n\\n\\nonly for a little while. Oh, my beloved, my whole heart and soul and\\r\\n\\n\\nlife goes out in this cry—_Come home!_”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                                 AGONY.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           _The peace that others seek they find;\\r\\n\\n\\n           The heaviest storms not longest last;\\r\\n\\n\\n           Heaven grants even to the guilty mind,\\r\\n\\n\\n           An amnesty for what is past.\\r\\n\\n\\n           I only pray to know the worst,\\r\\n\\n\\n           And wish, as if my heart would burst._—WORDSWORTH.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs before, day after day passed slowly and sadly over the head of the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung forsaken wife. The golden month of October was declining towards\\r\\n\\n\\nits close, and still she received no letter from her husband in answer\\r\\n\\n\\nto her last impassioned appeal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe wrote again and again; but with no better success. How he must have\\r\\n\\n\\nsteeled his breast against her to resist the pleading of her letters,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere every word seemed a tear of blood wrung from her crushed and\\r\\n\\n\\nbleeding heart. But most likely he did not even trust himself to read\\r\\n\\n\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn this agony of suspense, she must have either maddened or died, but\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the “little angel” she expected; for it is scarcely possible for the\\r\\n\\n\\nmother of an unborn babe, even under the greatest trials and heaviest\\r\\n\\n\\nsorrows, either to lose her reason, or break her heart. In making ready\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the little one, and in looking for its coming, she found an antidote\\r\\n\\n\\nagainst despair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut her moods, of course, varied with the state of her nerves. There\\r\\n\\n\\nwere times in which she hoped, when her hour should come, that both she\\r\\n\\n\\nand her babe might be permitted to die, and go to their eternal rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where I shall never trouble him more; or, perhaps regret him, either,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough this is doubtful. Oh, Alick! Alick!” she would exclaim, with a\\r\\n\\n\\nburst of tears and sobs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut these miserable spells of despondency she always repented as sins.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she, afterwards, prayed that her babe might live, and that she might\\r\\n\\n\\nbe forgiven, and spared and strengthened to raise it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was so young and inexperienced that she did not know when to count\\r\\n\\n\\nupon the advent of the little stranger; but she felt sure that the time\\r\\n\\n\\ncould not be far off.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was in the last days of October, that she received another letter\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom her recreant husband. She was standing at the window of her\\r\\n\\n\\nbed-chamber, watching for the arrival of Leo from the post-office, as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe had watched for so many days, when she saw the boy riding towards\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe tapped on the glass panes to attract his attention; and he heard\\r\\n\\n\\nher, and he pulled a letter from his pocket, and held it up to view as\\r\\n\\n\\nhe struck the spurs to his horse’s flanks and dashed rapidly up to the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe rushed down to meet him, and snatched the letter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“From Richmond, madam,” he said; “which I hope master is well, and is\\r\\n\\n\\ncoming home.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, from Richmond,” she said, tearing the envelope open, and beginning\\r\\n\\n\\nto run her eyes over it, as she went back to her room and sank into her\\r\\n\\n\\nresting chair. For the poor young wife and expectant mother could not\\r\\n\\n\\nnow rush about and excite herself with impunity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe sank, faint, dizzy and breathless, into her chair, and tried to read\\r\\n\\n\\nher letter; but the words ran together, and the lines reeled before her\\r\\n\\n\\neyes; and some minutes passed before she was sufficiently recovered and\\r\\n\\n\\ncalmed to do so. And as she gathered the meaning of this most cruel of\\r\\n\\n\\nall his heartless letters, her pale face grew paler still, her breath\\r\\n\\n\\ncame in short gasps, and her frame shook as with an ague fit.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore she had quite finished reading it, she let it drop from her\\r\\n\\n\\nhands, threw up her arms, and, with a piercing shriek, fell forward to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe floor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd well she might.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis murderous letter Alexander had sent to his wronged wife as a _coup\\r\\n\\n\\nde grace_.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn it he told her that humanity had induced him to prepare her, by a\\r\\n\\n\\nlong abstinence from her society, for the painful communication he was\\r\\n\\n\\nabout to make. He dared to hope that by this time she must have seen\\r\\n\\n\\nthat there was something wrong in their union, and some good cause other\\r\\n\\n\\nthan he had before stated for his keeping away from her. He said that\\r\\n\\n\\nnow he believed she was ready to learn, without a great shock, which he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad studied to spare her, the true cause of his parting from her. He\\r\\n\\n\\nthen went on to tell her that early in the month of March he had\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovered, to his own great astonishment, that their union was utterly\\r\\n\\n\\nnull, void, and illegal; that he could not find it in his heart at that\\r\\n\\n\\ntime to shock her with the fatal news; but he made up his mind to\\r\\n\\n\\nprepare her for it by degrees, and finally to break it to her very\\r\\n\\n\\nslowly. He begged to remind her that since the day upon which he had\\r\\n\\n\\nmade the discovery of the unlawfulness of their connection he had never\\r\\n\\n\\nwronged her by intruding into her private apartments, or treating her\\r\\n\\n\\notherwise than with the reserve due to a lady and the affection owed to\\r\\n\\n\\na sister. He repeated that he had tried to spare her pain in the\\r\\n\\n\\nbreaking of this tie, the severance of which was as distressing to him\\r\\n\\n\\nas it could possibly be to her. He assured her that, though duty forbade\\r\\n\\n\\nhim ever to see her face again, he should provide for her future\\r\\n\\n\\nwelfare, by securing to her the little estate upon which she lived. He\\r\\n\\n\\nconcluded by telling her, that as propriety required all possible\\r\\n\\n\\nintercourse, even by writing, to cease between them, and as he himself\\r\\n\\n\\nwas about to leave town for the country, it would be useless for her to\\r\\n\\n\\nreply to his letter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt is to be noted that in this cruel communication he took care to say\\r\\n\\n\\nno more than was absolutely necessary to quell and quiet her claims on\\r\\n\\n\\nhim. He did not even call her by name, but addressed her as “my poor\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle friend.” He did not acknowledge the receipt of any of her\\r\\n\\n\\nletters. And, worse than all, he failed to specify the cause of the\\r\\n\\n\\nalleged illegality of their marriage—whether it had chanced in any\\r\\n\\n\\ninformality of the ceremony, which might be remedied by a second and\\r\\n\\n\\nmore careful solemnization of the rites; or whether it existed in the\\r\\n\\n\\nshape of some insurmountable impediment that must forbid their union.\\r\\n\\n\\nNor did he venture to allude to his former betrothal and his approaching\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding with his cousin Anna. Indeed, all proper names of persons and\\r\\n\\n\\nplaces seemed studiously left out. The writing also, was in a disguised\\r\\n\\n\\nhand, and without date or signature.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAltogether it was a careful work of a cautious man, who would have been\\r\\n\\n\\nan astute villain and a successful schemer if he had not, in the\\r\\n\\n\\nblindness of his selfishness, overreached even himself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt bore no internal signs of the writer or of the person to whom it was\\r\\n\\n\\nwritten. It might have been sent by another man to another woman. It\\r\\n\\n\\ncould never be successfully produced in evidence against any one in any\\r\\n\\n\\ncourt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut if he took this precaution with the idea that his deeply wronged\\r\\n\\n\\nwife could ever drag her domestic sorrows before a public tribunal, and\\r\\n\\n\\nexpose his private letters for her own vindication, he had studied her\\r\\n\\n\\ncharacter to very little purpose.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe blow he had dealt had well nigh proved her death stroke. It struck\\r\\n\\n\\nher to the floor. Her cry and her fall aroused her servants, who came\\r\\n\\n\\nrunning to her room in haste. They found her stretched in a swoon on the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarpet, with the open letter beside her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Master’s dead now, for sure!” exclaimed Leo, in consternation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And no harm done if he is!” cried Pina, who had, with her woman’s wit,\\r\\n\\n\\nlong ago detected the bad faith.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But it’s killed mist’ess!” groaned the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It hain’t! it’s only overcome her like! Help me to get her up, and\\r\\n\\n\\ndon’t stand there blubbering!” said the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBetween them they tenderly lifted their mistress and laid her on her\\r\\n\\n\\nbed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, Leo, you go out and stop in the passage, so as to be in calling\\r\\n\\n\\ndistance if I want anything. And leave me alone with my madam. I’ve seen\\r\\n\\n\\nher in these here fainty fits before, and I know what to do with her.\\r\\n\\n\\nCome, now!” impatiently exclaimed Pina, seeing that her brother still\\r\\n\\n\\nlingered, “be off with you, will you? It ain’t no ways proper for you to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe looking on while I’m unloosening of her clothes!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis hint drove the boy in haste from the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina proceeded to undress her mistress, turning her about very gently on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe bed, until she had freed all her fastenings so as to give her lungs\\r\\n\\n\\nthe fullest play. Then she applied the usual potent stimulants, and\\r\\n\\n\\nafter much patient effort, she had the pleasure of seeing the little\\r\\n\\n\\nlady open her eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Drusilla recovered her senses only to fall into the most violent\\r\\n\\n\\nparoxysms of grief and despair. Convulsive sobs shook her whole frame;\\r\\n\\n\\nbitter groans burst from her lips; tears gushed in torrents from her\\r\\n\\n\\neyes. As her passion of grief arose, she wrung her hands, and writhed,\\r\\n\\n\\nand threw herself from side to side, moaning piteously. Then in her\\r\\n\\n\\nfrenzy of despair, she sprang up and began walking about the room,\\r\\n\\n\\nstriking her hands together, and uttering piercing cries.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn truth, hers was not a mute grief. Your “silent sorrow” belongs to a\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle later period of life, when years have taught the sufferer such\\r\\n\\n\\nresignation that she will “die and make no sign.” But on this stricken\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung wife a blow had fallen, heavy enough to crush the strongest woman,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile she was yet little more than a child. And she felt it with all a\\r\\n\\n\\nchild’s intense sensibility, and she grieved with a child’s excessive\\r\\n\\n\\nvehemence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nVainly her maid tried to restrain her or to comfort her, Pina followed\\r\\n\\n\\nher mistress up and down the room, weeping for company, and pleading\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her—\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, mist’ess darling, don’t take on so dreadful! Don’t mist’ess, that’s\\r\\n\\n\\na dear! Oh, what has happened? Tell your true servant, who never left\\r\\n\\n\\nyou but only once, and never will do so wicked an act again, never, if\\r\\n\\n\\nthere’s twenty robbers in the house. Oh, mist’ess, what’s the matter?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, girl, girl, he has left me, he has left me forever,” cried the poor\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung wife, with another gush of tears.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd it showed how utterly abject and self-abandoned she was in her\\r\\n\\n\\nprofound and terrible sorrow, when she could forget her dignity, and\\r\\n\\n\\nmake complaint in the presence of her youthful servant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He has left me, Pina! Oh, he has left me forever!” she repeated,\\r\\n\\n\\nwringing her hands and sobbing violently. “He has gone, he has gone for\\r\\n\\n\\ngood!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Blest if I don’t think it _is_ for good! and a good riddance of\\r\\n\\n\\nuncommon bad rubbish!” grumbled the girl in a low voice; but she did not\\r\\n\\n\\ndare to let her words be heard.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what shall I do? Oh, what shall I do?” cried the wretched wife,\\r\\n\\n\\nwalking wildly about the room and wringing her hands. “He has left me\\r\\n\\n\\nforever! forever and ever!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t you believe one word of that, ma’am, now, don’t, that’s a dear\\r\\n\\n\\nlady! Lors, he wouldn’t have the heart! he couldn’t stay away from you\\r\\n\\n\\nforever, no, not if he was to try to ever so hard,” said Pina,\\r\\n\\n\\nsoothingly, as she followed her mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But he says so himself! he says so!” exclaimed Drusilla, with a\\r\\n\\n\\npassionate burst of weeping.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, he says so, and maybe he thinks so, but he can’t do it. It’s only\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause some wicked woman has got the whip hand of him now. But lor\\r\\n\\n\\nbless you, _that_ can’t last. All men is fools, ma’am. I know that much,\\r\\n\\n\\nif I don’t know any more. But lor! the foolishest of ’em knows gold from\\r\\n\\n\\nbrass, and is sure to come back to the old love and the true love, for\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir _own_ interests. Goodness knows they never does anything for ours!\\r\\n\\n\\nHe’ll come back, ma’am! Bad pennies always does.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh,” moaned Drusilla, “how low I have fallen! how low, to say what I\\r\\n\\n\\nhave said, and to hear what I have heard! Pina, my girl, hush. You must\\r\\n\\n\\nnot speak of your master in this manner, especially in my presence. It\\r\\n\\n\\nis untrue of him and disrespectful to us both,” she added, as calmly as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe could force herself to speak, as she dropped into her resting chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was but a short lull in the storm of her grief; for presently, the\\r\\n\\n\\nkeen sense of her husband’s desertion and her own desolation, pierced\\r\\n\\n\\nher heart, and she fell into a fresh paroxysm of sobs and tears, and\\r\\n\\n\\nleaving her chair, walked distractedly about the room, raving and\\r\\n\\n\\nwringing her hands as before.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina went to her and threw her arms around her, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, mist’ess, mist’ess, don’t do so! You’ll kill yourself and kill your\\r\\n\\n\\nchild!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Better I were dead! better my child should never be born!” cried the\\r\\n\\n\\nfrantic woman, abandoning herself to the wildest excesses of despair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, mist’ess, don’t say so! and don’t rave so! If you have no pity for\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself, have some for the poor little blind and breathless baby that\\r\\n\\n\\ndepends on you for its life; and don’t kill it before it has even a soul\\r\\n\\n\\nto be saved!” pleaded Pina, touching the most sensitive chord in the\\r\\n\\n\\nmother’s heart and in the Christian conscience.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Give me something! Give me something to benumb this keen pang, then.\\r\\n\\n\\nGive me opium! Give me anything that will dull my heart and brain\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout doing harm,” she demanded, sitting down in her chair, and making\\r\\n\\n\\na great effort to control the violence of her emotions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina mixed a composing draught of tincture of valerian and water and\\r\\n\\n\\nbrought it to her mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla drank it, and its effect upon her sensitive system was\\r\\n\\n\\ninstantaneous and powerful. Though her eyes still streamed with tears,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe convulsive heavings of her bosom subsided, and she became\\r\\n\\n\\ncomparatively calm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, mist’ess, darlin’, you just let me help you to bed and you lay\\r\\n\\n\\nstill and keep quiet. And I will darken the room and sit by you. And may\\r\\n\\n\\nbe you will go to sleep and then you will be better.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla, docile as a child now, suffered her maid to put her to\\r\\n\\n\\nbed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile the girl was smoothing the white counterpane and making everything\\r\\n\\n\\ntidy about the dainty couch, Drusilla suddenly put her hand to her\\r\\n\\n\\nthroat and with a frightened look cried out:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where—where is—?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you mean the little black silk bag, ma’am, that was tied around you\\r\\n\\n\\nneck?” inquired Pina.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes! yes! where is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I took it off when I undressed you, while you were in your fainty fit.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where did you put it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In your upper bureau drawer, ma’am, where it is quite safe.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Pina, bring it back to me directly.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl obeyed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is it a relic, ma’am?” inquired Pina.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” answered her mistress. And so it was, though not of the sort Pina\\r\\n\\n\\nwas thinking of.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I beg pardon—I didn’t know, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, Pina, no matter how ill I may become, you must never let this\\r\\n\\n\\nbe removed from my bosom again. It is more precious to me than anything\\r\\n\\n\\nI have in the world except my Bible and my wedding-ring,” said Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nas she fastened the treasure around her neck.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, ma’am! Then I will be very careful not to have it removed. Now\\r\\n\\n\\ntry to compose yourself, ma’am,” said Pina, as she proceeded to close\\r\\n\\n\\nthe shutters and draw the curtains to darken the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla complied with this good advice, and folding her hands as if in\\r\\n\\n\\nprayer, lay very quietly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina went to the chamber door and spoke to Leo, who had remained on duty\\r\\n\\n\\nin the passage for some hours. She told him that their mistress was now\\r\\n\\n\\nbetter, and that he might go down stairs and look after his own affairs,\\r\\n\\n\\nand that she would call him if his services should be needed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo, glad to hear of the little lady’s improvement, glad also to be\\r\\n\\n\\nrelieved from duty, hurried down into the kitchen to look for something\\r\\n\\n\\nto eat, of which he stood greatly in need, not having broken his fast\\r\\n\\n\\nsince he went to the post-office in the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina took her place by her mistress’s bed, and patiently watched there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNight deepened; but the girl lighted no lamp, finding the subdued glow\\r\\n\\n\\nof the low wood-fire on the hearth sufficient to see by.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla lay so motionless that Pina thought she slept. But by bending\\r\\n\\n\\ndown and looking attentively at the supposed sleeper, the watcher saw\\r\\n\\n\\nthat her lips were moving as in silent prayer. And soon deep sighs arose\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom the sufferer’s bosom, and large tears rolled down her face. She was\\r\\n\\n\\nawake and weeping.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina silently arose and mixed another dose of the beneficial composing\\r\\n\\n\\ndraught, and brought it to the bedside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla drank it. And soon after she fell asleep. And the youthful\\r\\n\\n\\nwatcher, with her heavy head dropped upon the side of the bed, also\\r\\n\\n\\nslept well.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                               SUSPENSE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n              Oh, weary struggle! Silent tears\\r\\n\\n\\n              Tell seemingly no doubtful tale;\\r\\n\\n\\n              And yet they leave it short, and fears\\r\\n\\n\\n              And hopes are strong and will prevail.\\r\\n\\n\\n              My calmest fate escapes not pain;\\r\\n\\n\\n              And, feeling that the hope is vain,\\r\\n\\n\\n              I think that he will come again.—WORDSWORTH.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt daylight Pina awoke. Finding her mistress still sleeping heavily\\r\\n\\n\\nunder the influence of the sedative, she arose and replenished the fire\\r\\n\\n\\nand then went down stairs and got her own breakfast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter which she prepared some very strong coffee and some delicate milk\\r\\n\\n\\ntoast, and took it up to the lady’s chamber and set it upon the hearth\\r\\n\\n\\nto be kept warm until her mistress should awake.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut with the hapless young wife the awakening was but the return to\\r\\n\\n\\nanguish.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith great difficulty Pina prevailed on her to take a little food. There\\r\\n\\n\\nwas but one argument the girl could successfully use with the expectant\\r\\n\\n\\nmother—her child. To keep up her strength for its sake, Drusilla tried\\r\\n\\n\\nto eat and drink, though even the coffee and the soft toast seemed to\\r\\n\\n\\nchoke her in her effort to swallow them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter this little repast she fell back upon her pillow, too\\r\\n\\n\\nspirit-broken to wish to leave her bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina opened the front windows to let in the cheerful light of the golden\\r\\n\\n\\nautumn morning; and then she took the breakfast tray down into the\\r\\n\\n\\nkitchen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo was sitting there, polishing his cutlery.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How’s mist’ess?” inquired the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It’s hard to say. I know I’d rather see her in a rale bad spell of\\r\\n\\n\\nillness, like the typus fever, or something, than this way. Her heart’s\\r\\n\\n\\nbroke; that’s how she is. And I tell you what, Leo, long’s master’s done\\r\\n\\n\\nbroke faith with mist’ess I don’t see how we got any call to keep faith\\r\\n\\n\\nlong o’ him,” grumbled the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Broke faith with her?” echoed the boy, pausing in his work.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that letter he writ said he wasn’t coming back no more. And that’s\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat’s killed her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My goodness!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now look here, Leo—if _he’s_ not coming back to take care of her,\\r\\n\\n\\nsomebody must, that is certain. I don’t know enough, although I did help\\r\\n\\n\\nmammy to bring up all my little brothers and sisters.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, what do you want _me_ to do? I’ll do anything in the world for\\r\\n\\n\\nmist’ess.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I tell you. Leo, I want you to go down to Alexdry and fetch mammy\\r\\n\\n\\nto her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But good gracious me alive, that is as much as my ears are worth!\\r\\n\\n\\nDidn’t master order us not to have any followers, not even our own kin\\r\\n\\n\\nfolks?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I told you before, if master don’t keep faith long o’ mist’ess, we\\r\\n\\n\\nain’t got no call to keep faith long o’ him, ’specially when it’s to\\r\\n\\n\\nrist her life.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, if that’s the case, I’ll go at once,” answered the boy. For it was\\r\\n\\n\\nonly necessary to convince him that his mistress’s safety depended on\\r\\n\\n\\n“mammy’s” arrival to make him eager to go and fetch her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYet just as he was about to leave the kitchen he turned and inquired;\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But isn’t better to ask mist’ess first?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_No_; she would be sure to object, though it’s for her own safety. You\\r\\n\\n\\ngo and fetch mammy. And then I’ll let on to mist’ess how she come on a\\r\\n\\n\\nwisit to me, promiscuous like, and I’ll ’vise mist’ess to see mammy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right; but if you get me into a scrape for nothing, you know, Pina,\\r\\n\\n\\nit will be your own fault.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Just so; and I’ll be willing to bear all the blame.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo went upon his errand, and Pina hurried up to her mistress’s chamber.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla had thrown herself out of bed, and was walking distractedly up\\r\\n\\n\\nand down the room, with her dark hair falling down over her white\\r\\n\\n\\nnight-dress, her face pale, her eyes wild, and her fingers wreathed and\\r\\n\\n\\nwrung together in an agony of grief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nVain were all Pina’s efforts to soothe her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I do but feel my trouble more and more! more and more as the hours\\r\\n\\n\\ngo by! If I only could see him! If I could see him once and speak to\\r\\n\\n\\nhim, he would hear me! he could not let me die before his sight,” she\\r\\n\\n\\nsobbed forth, with her eyes streaming with tears, whose fountains seemed\\r\\n\\n\\nexhaustless.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It’s like p’isoning of her to save her life; but it’s what the doctors\\r\\n\\n\\ndo, and I must do it,” said Pina, as she poured out a large dose of\\r\\n\\n\\nvalerian and coaxed the sufferer to drink it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs before, the powerful sedative quickly took effect. And Drusilla let\\r\\n\\n\\nher maid lead her to her resting chair near the window, and seat her in\\r\\n\\n\\nit, and put a foot cushion under her feet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There, mist’ess, sit there and be quiet. I wouldn’t lay down on the bed\\r\\n\\n\\ntoo much. It isn’t good for you. Sit by the window and look out at the\\r\\n\\n\\nLord’s good sunshine. Bless you, the sun shines still, spite of all the\\r\\n\\n\\nfools and wilyuns in the world. And here, I’ll bring you your Bible and\\r\\n\\n\\nset it on your little stand before you. You used to take comfort in your\\r\\n\\n\\nBible. Lor’! if we only loved _Him_ half as well as we do some of his\\r\\n\\n\\nonworthy creeturs we needn’t have our hearts broke by ’em,” said Pina,\\r\\n\\n\\nas she made the arrangement she proposed. But her last sentiment was\\r\\n\\n\\nspoken _sotto voce_ and did not reach the ears of her inattentive\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nInstead of deriving the consolation from the sacred volume which indeed\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was too much overcome to seek, Drusilla dropped her head upon its\\r\\n\\n\\nopen pages and seemed to pray, or weep, in silence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To think, when she gets wiolent, I have to knock her down with a dose\\r\\n\\n\\nof walerian this way! It’s a most like murder. And how’s it a gwine to\\r\\n\\n\\nend? I wish mammy would come. I hope she ’aint got no engagement nowhere\\r\\n\\n\\nelse,” muttered Pina to herself as she went and made up the bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt noon it was a work of difficulty and of diplomacy for Pina to get her\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress to swallow a few spoonfuls of the chicken broth she had\\r\\n\\n\\nprepared for her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the afternoon Drusilla was so much prostrated that Pina assisted her\\r\\n\\n\\nto bed, and darkened the room, that she might sleep, if possible.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLate in the evening Leo returned from Alexandria, bringing with him a\\r\\n\\n\\nmiddle-aged, motherly-looking colored woman, who called herself “Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nHector, honey,” but whom Pina rushed to embrace as “mammy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs soon as the overjoyed daughter had relieved her mammy of bonnet,\\r\\n\\n\\nshawl and umbrella, and had sent them by Leo with the “big box, little\\r\\n\\n\\nbox, ban-box and bundle,” up to the servants’ bedrooms over the kitchen,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe set about getting tea for the traveller.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe laid a cloth upon which she arranged her own best service, with cold\\r\\n\\n\\nham, fried chicken, fresh butter, Maryland biscuits, and, lastly, a pot\\r\\n\\n\\nof fragrant imperial.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile Leo was out in the stable attending to his horses, the mother and\\r\\n\\n\\ndaughter sat down to the table together.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now what sort of a home is this here you’ve got here, gal, where the\\r\\n\\n\\nmarser is allus gone and the missus allus grievin’ day in and day out?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, mammy, you know as one follows the other; and if the master’s\\r\\n\\n\\nalways gone the mist’ess is likely to be always grieving, if so be she\\r\\n\\n\\ncares for him, which our mist’ess do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What’s he gone so much for? It looks bad.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So it do, mammy, which it is bad too.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But what’s he gone _for_?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He say business—let me see—connected—yes, that’s it—with his late\\r\\n\\n\\nfather’s will.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Um hum; allus some excuse with them men. To begin so airly, too; ‘fore\\r\\n\\n\\nhe’s married a year. Lor’, I thought you was agoing to have such a happy\\r\\n\\n\\nhome, living fellow sarvint with your own dear brother, long of a young\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried pair with the highest of wages, and no ’sideration but to live\\r\\n\\n\\nquiet and keep away company. But, deary me! who can count on anything?\\r\\n\\n\\nWell, gal, I’m glad to get leave to come to see you at last. But what\\r\\n\\n\\ncan I do for you? That boy, Leo, I couldn’t get nothink out’n him, ’cept\\r\\n\\n\\n’twas the marser was allus gone and the missus was allus grievin’, and\\r\\n\\n\\nyou wanted me to come and nuss her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, mammy, that was it. And I hope you can stop now you are here.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I can stop fast enough. I have just got through nussin Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nPorter with her fifth. And Liza Jane, she’s out of service now and\\r\\n\\n\\nstopping home with me to mend up her clothes; so she can take care of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house and chillun.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How is sister Liza Jane and the rest?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, they’s well enough. All had the fever ’n agur in the airly part of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe season, but when the frost came it killed it. But where’s the young\\r\\n\\n\\nmadam?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sleeping now, mammy. I had to give her a great big dose of walerian.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_You—you_ dare to dose a lady? Look here, gal, don’t you set yourself\\r\\n\\n\\nup for a doctoress because your mammy’s one.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor’, mammy, what’s walerian? I’ve seen you give it to ladies for the\\r\\n\\n\\nhysterics by tea spoonfuls.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Seen _me_? Yes, but I tell you what, gal, you’ve got to p’izen a great\\r\\n\\n\\nmany patients before you can be trusted to give physic like an ole\\r\\n\\n\\n’oman. But don’t you try that on again, gal, I tell you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor’, mammy, what on the yeth was I to do with her, when she was raving\\r\\n\\n\\ndistracted mad a-most? a pacing up and down the room a tearing of her\\r\\n\\n\\nbeautiful hair out by the roots, and wringing and a twisting of her\\r\\n\\n\\nfingers often her hands all but! I ’clare to the Lord and man I was\\r\\n\\n\\n’fraid of my soul as she’d dash herself against a wall, or fling herself\\r\\n\\n\\nout’n the window. And nothing on yeth but walerian would quell her.\\r\\n\\n\\nThat’s the reason I sent for you. I didn’t like to take the\\r\\n\\n\\n’sponsability to keep on a knocking of her over with that there weepon;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut I couldn’t let her ’stroy herself neither, so I had to give it to\\r\\n\\n\\nher, whether or no, till you came.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But what on the yeth did the creetur take on so about? Not _his_ being\\r\\n\\n\\naway.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it was, mammy. His being away and his disappointing of her by not\\r\\n\\n\\ncoming back when he promised. Men is such wilyuns!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And wimmin is sich fools! For my part, when the chillun’s well the men\\r\\n\\n\\nmay go to Old Nick for me! But she ’aint got no chillun to comfort her,\\r\\n\\n\\npoor young thing.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not _yet_, mother,” said Pina, significantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Not yet?’ What do you mean, gal? _Soon will!_”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, mammy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“When?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t know exactly; neither does she; but soon; and that’s another\\r\\n\\n\\nreason why I sent for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Um hum. Well, if that’s so, she’s not to be let to go raving and\\r\\n\\n\\ntearing about, let who will come or stay away,” said the wise woman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe abrupt entrance of Leo put an end to this part of the gossip.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe boy sat down at the table and took his tea.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, mammy,” said Pina, “as it’s late and you’re tired, I’ll show\\r\\n\\n\\nyou where you are to sleep. _I_ shall have to stop in the room with the\\r\\n\\n\\nmist’ess.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And mind you, don’t give her any more physic, ’out calling me fust,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid mammy, as she followed her daughter up to the little room above the\\r\\n\\n\\nkitchen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina dismissed Leo to the stable loft, fastened up the house, raked out\\r\\n\\n\\nthe kitchen fire, and then returned to her mistress’s chamber.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe poor little lady was in a troubled sleep, broken by fitful sighs and\\r\\n\\n\\nsobs, and muttered words of which “Alick” was the only one to be\\r\\n\\n\\ndistinctly heard.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina just loosened her own clothes and sat down in the lounging chair by\\r\\n\\n\\nthe side of the bed to watch or sleep, as the case might be. She slept,\\r\\n\\n\\nof course; and her sleep was so deep that she did not know her, mistress\\r\\n\\n\\nawoke and arose a little after midnight and paced the floor, weeping and\\r\\n\\n\\nwringing her hands, until daylight, when she fell exhausted upon the bed\\r\\n\\n\\nand dropped into a short and fitful slumber, disturbed with gasps and\\r\\n\\n\\nstarts.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBy sunrise Pina opened her own eyes, and seeing her mistress lying very\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch as she had left her when she fell asleep, the girl arose and\\r\\n\\n\\nreplenished the fire and went down into the kitchen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere she found “mammy” making herself at home and in full blast before\\r\\n\\n\\nthe range getting the breakfast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, and when am I to see the madam, I’d like to know?” inquired Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nHector.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Soon’s ever she wakes, mammy; which you know you couldn’t see her last\\r\\n\\n\\nnight, ’pon account of you being tired and she sleepy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How is she this morning?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sleeping like an angel, which so she’s been a doing of all night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Um hum, you been a giving of her more o’ that walerian!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Deed I aint, mammy, which she hasn’t needed of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen Pina and her mother and brother had had their breakfast, the girl\\r\\n\\n\\nprepared some rich and delicate chocolate and some nice light muffins\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her mistress’s morning meal, and took them up to the lady’s chamber.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla was awake, though pale and worn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter having bathed her face and hands with diluted Florida water, she\\r\\n\\n\\nconsented to take a little of the refreshments that Pina brought and sat\\r\\n\\n\\nupon a stand by her bedside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile Drusilla sat up in bed and sipped her chocolate, Pina broached the\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject of her mother’s presence in the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mist’ess, I want to tell you, ma’am, as my ole mammy has come to see\\r\\n\\n\\nme, a little bit. I hope you has nothing of no objection _now_, ma’am?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“None in the world, Pina. Mr. Lyon——” She had nearly broken down and\\r\\n\\n\\nwept again when she pronounced his name; but she gasped, recovered\\r\\n\\n\\nherself and went on—“Mr. Lyon used to object to having even your\\r\\n\\n\\nrelatives come to the house, but now that he is not here their coming or\\r\\n\\n\\ngoing can make no difference.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you don’t object on your own account, ma’am?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Pina, no; I don’t. It is good to have your mother to come to see\\r\\n\\n\\nyou. I wish, oh, how I _do_ wish I had a mother to come to see me, in my\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat trouble!” she added, with a little sob.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe tears rose to Pina’s eyes, as she answered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My mammy is only a poor colored ’oman; but indeed, ma’am, if you will\\r\\n\\n\\nlet her, she will do for you as loving and as tender as any mother.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will she stay with you long, Pina!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She would like to stay some weeks, if you would let her, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She can stay as long as she likes, for your sake, my good girl. But\\r\\n\\n\\nyour mother—she must be in years, Pina?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She’s past fifty, ma’am, I believe.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is she—experienced?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beg pardon, ma’am?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is she—wise, skillful, knowing, I mean, about sickness and about\\r\\n\\n\\nchildren?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh! yes, ma’am, which that is her perfession, brought up to it, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I think it very providential that she is here now. Oh, I am very\\r\\n\\n\\ninexperienced and helpless! Pina, I think I should like to see your\\r\\n\\n\\nmother and have a little talk with her. When you take away this service\\r\\n\\n\\nyou may bring her up.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes, ma’am! thank you, ma’am. She’ll be so glad to pay her ’spects\\r\\n\\n\\nto you,” said the girl, delighted that the proposal she had so much\\r\\n\\n\\ndreaded to make, had been so kindly received.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the moment Pina left the room, Drusilla fell back upon her pillow in\\r\\n\\n\\na storm of sobs and tears, and gasping forth at intervals:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick! Alick dear, to leave me at such a time as this, and I so\\r\\n\\n\\nfriendless and so ignorant, I might die! I wish I could!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter a few moments, hearing footsteps on the stairs, she ceased\\r\\n\\n\\nsobbing, and tried to compose herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina discreetly knocked at the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wait a moment,” said Drusilla, wiping her eyes and smothering the last\\r\\n\\n\\nconvulsive throes of her bosom. And then——“Come in,” she called.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina entered, showing in her mother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla turned with forced calmness to welcome the stranger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How do you do? What is your name?” she inquired, in a gentle tone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My name’s Aunt Hector, honey, ladies’ nuss, which I have recommendments\\r\\n\\n\\nto show from the head doctors, ma’am,” answered “mammy,” curtseying.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think it very fortunate for me that you are here. I hope you will be\\r\\n\\n\\nable to stay with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Which it is my intention so to do, long as I shall be wanted, honey,\\r\\n\\n\\nand no longer.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, I would like to talk with you a little. I have no mother,\\r\\n\\n\\nand I am as ignorant as a child of many things I ought to know—Pina, my\\r\\n\\n\\ngood girl, you may leave the room, and you needn’t come back until you\\r\\n\\n\\nare called. I wish to speak in private to this good nurse.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs Pina left the room and closed the door behind her, mammy turned to\\r\\n\\n\\nher patient, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope, ma’am, that gal does her duty, which it is always my pride and\\r\\n\\n\\nambition to bring up my chillun so to do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She is a very good girl, and pleases me perfectly.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am oncommon glad to hear it, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now I wish to speak to you of——” Drusilla hesitated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, honey, I understand. Speak out and don’t mind me. I’m an ole nuss,\\r\\n\\n\\nyou know, chile.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThus encouraged, Drusilla began to speak of the state of her own health,\\r\\n\\n\\nof her youthful inexperience, and of her forlorn circumstances.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn doing this she tried to cover the sin of her guilty husband, by\\r\\n\\n\\nexplaining his absence in the stereotyped manner that he himself had\\r\\n\\n\\noften used, and putting it upon the ground of “business connected with\\r\\n\\n\\nhis late father’s will.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut this effort was too much for her superficial composure. The very\\r\\n\\n\\nname of Mr. Lyon overthrew her self-control. In speaking of him her\\r\\n\\n\\nvoice faltered, then she choked, gasped and broke into a violent fit of\\r\\n\\n\\nsobs and tears that shook her fragile frame almost to the point of\\r\\n\\n\\ndissolution.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe nurse was much too wise to coax or scold her patient. But the sly\\r\\n\\n\\nold fox, who had blown her daughter up for meddling with dangerous\\r\\n\\n\\ndrugs, went herself and mixed a composing draught for the sufferer—and\\r\\n\\n\\nnot of the harmless valerian that had been administered by Pina, but of\\r\\n\\n\\npotent morphine that in a few moments sent Drusilla into a sleep that\\r\\n\\n\\nlasted all that afternoon and night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut, ah! when she did at length awake, on this the third morning after\\r\\n\\n\\nthe great blow had fallen on her, she awoke but to the renewal of\\r\\n\\n\\nanguish intolerable; of sorrow that refused to be comforted; of despair\\r\\n\\n\\nthat had forgotten the very existence of hope.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                          HOPING AGAINST HOPE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n             ’Tis hard, so young—so young as I am still,\\r\\n\\n\\n               To feel forevermore from life depart\\r\\n\\n\\n             All that can flatter the poor human will,\\r\\n\\n\\n                   Or fill the heart.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n             Yet there was nothing in that sweet and brief.\\r\\n\\n\\n               And perished intercourse, now closed to me,\\r\\n\\n\\n             To add one thought unto my bitterest grief\\r\\n\\n\\n                   Upbraiding thee.      —OWEN MEREDITH.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt would be too painful to follow the young and deeply wronged wife\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough the first weeks of her great trouble.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were passed in paroxysms of vehement and inconsolable sorrow,\\r\\n\\n\\nalternating with periods of dull stupor, partly the result of reaction\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom high excitement, and partly the influence of the nervine sedative\\r\\n\\n\\nadministered by her nurse.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe course pursued by this woman in the treatment of her young patient\\r\\n\\n\\nwas upon the whole very judicious. She did not lecture her on the\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject of her inordinate abandonment to grief and despair. But she\\r\\n\\n\\nartfully drew her attention away from the contemplation of her troubles,\\r\\n\\n\\nto the consideration of those last and most important preparations for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe arrival of the little expected stranger, in which mothers and nurses\\r\\n\\n\\nusually find such absorbing interest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe amused the youthful matron with certain necessary alterations in the\\r\\n\\n\\narrangements of her chamber, with fitting up of an adjoining room as a\\r\\n\\n\\nnursery, with the decorating and furnishing of an infant’s basket, and a\\r\\n\\n\\nberceaunette or wicker cradle, and with the arranging of the liliputian\\r\\n\\n\\nwardrobe in a beautiful miniature bureau.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn these natural and pleasing occupations, Drusilla found some relief\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom her heavy sorrow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe late October weather was glorious with all the gorgeous splendor of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Indian summer, glowing through the heavens and the earth, and\\r\\n\\n\\nkindling up the foliage around the wildwood home with a beauty and\\r\\n\\n\\nrefulgence of color, richer and brighter than those of spring or summer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith the advice of the nurse, Drusilla every morning took a short drive\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough the woods, and every afternoon a slow saunter into the flower\\r\\n\\n\\ngarden.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUnder happier auspices, this child of nature would have derived much\\r\\n\\n\\nenjoyment from the season and the scene. Even in her misery she felt\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething of their soothing and cheering influence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the beneficial effect of this course was soon apparent in her. Her\\r\\n\\n\\nparoxysms of grief became less frequent and violent. Her nerves grew\\r\\n\\n\\ncalmer, and her brain clearer. With this healthy reaction came\\r\\n\\n\\nreflection. She thought upon the fixed past, the troubled present, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe doubtful future.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe now exonerated Alexander of all blame in his cruel neglect of her.\\r\\n\\n\\nHe thought, she mused, that their marriage was illegal, and therefore he\\r\\n\\n\\nwas just in his avoidance of her. He knew that the separation would go\\r\\n\\n\\nnear to kill her, and therefore he was merciful in gently loosening the\\r\\n\\n\\ntie, instead of suddenly wrenching it apart. He felt that loving and\\r\\n\\n\\ntender letters would but melt and weaken her heart, and therefore he was\\r\\n\\n\\nwise in writing shortly and coldly. No doubt he suffered—poor Alick! as\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch as she did, though he would not add to her distress by telling her\\r\\n\\n\\nso. He had loved her so much! so much! and now he was heroic in his\\r\\n\\n\\nself-restraint for her sake! So she justified him to her own heart. For\\r\\n\\n\\nto honor him was with her even a greater necessity than to love him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she wondered that he did not tell her the reason why he thought his\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage with her was illegal. And more than all she wondered what that\\r\\n\\n\\nuntold reason could be. Her conjectures wandered over every possible and\\r\\n\\n\\nimpossible theory of the case:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFirst, that Alexander while at college, or while in Europe, had\\r\\n\\n\\ncontracted a secret marriage; that when he wedded her he believed\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself a widower; and that he had recently discovered the existence of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis first wife. But this theory was no sooner conceived than rejected;\\r\\n\\n\\nfor she remembered that he had been solemnly betrothed to his Cousin\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna from her earliest youth, and that upon his return from Europe he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad been about to marry her, when the wedding was arrested by the death\\r\\n\\n\\nof his father.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSecondly, that this very pre-contract to Anna Lyon, might have rendered\\r\\n\\n\\nhis marriage with her (Drusilla) illegal. But this was also set aside as\\r\\n\\n\\nunreasonable, for she recollected that the contract had been broken by\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon, as he himself had assured his bride.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThirdly, that Alexander had discovered some very near blood relationship\\r\\n\\n\\nbetween himself and his wife that made their union unlawful. But this\\r\\n\\n\\nwas at once repudiated as quite impossible, for she knew his genealogy,\\r\\n\\n\\nas well as her own, could be too distinctly and too far traced to admit\\r\\n\\n\\nof such an idea.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo imagination traversed the whole field of possibility and\\r\\n\\n\\nimpossibility, and found nothing to invalidate her marriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she came to this conclusion: (and in it her instinct sided with her\\r\\n\\n\\nreason)—that there never had existed any sort of impediment to her union\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her husband, and her marriage was perfectly lawful and righteous.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd _now_ did she blame him?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOh no! she ascribed his whole conduct to——\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMONOMANIA!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when she found this answer to her inexplicable riddle, she could\\r\\n\\n\\nhave sung and danced for joy!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer marriage was not illegal; it was only private. And her adored\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband was not faithless; he was only mistaken.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe had been told of monomania—she had heard how men might be a little\\r\\n\\n\\ninsane for a time upon one single subject, while perfectly sane upon all\\r\\n\\n\\nothers. She knew also that this was not a dangerous type of madness, but\\r\\n\\n\\nwas often only the transient effects of fever, passing off with\\r\\n\\n\\nreturning health. She wondered whether he had been ill.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUnder this view of the case, she resolved to write to him. True, he had\\r\\n\\n\\nforbidden her to do so; and even assured her it would be useless for her\\r\\n\\n\\nto write, as he was about to leave Richmond for a tour through the\\r\\n\\n\\ncounties.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she reflected he must have left directions at the Richmond\\r\\n\\n\\npost-office to have his letters forwarded to him wherever he should be,\\r\\n\\n\\nand her letter directed to Richmond would be sent after him with the\\r\\n\\n\\nrest of his correspondents’.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo she sat down and wrote him a letter—patient, loving, pitiful, and\\r\\n\\n\\neven cheerful; gravely reasoning with him upon the fallacy of his idea\\r\\n\\n\\nthat their marriage could possibly be unlawful; playfully inviting him\\r\\n\\n\\nto return that she might convince him how very righteous and legal their\\r\\n\\n\\nunion was; then tenderly pleading with him to come and be with her in\\r\\n\\n\\nher approaching hour of trial and danger. She said no word, dropped no\\r\\n\\n\\nhint of the bitter anguish his letter had inflicted upon her, of how\\r\\n\\n\\nnearly her brain had been crazed, her heart broken, and her life lost in\\r\\n\\n\\ndespair. Nothing that could possibly distress him did she write; but all\\r\\n\\n\\nshe could think of to convince, comfort and cheer him. And she prayed\\r\\n\\n\\nHeaven to bless him; and she signed herself his true wife, for time and\\r\\n\\n\\nfor eternity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen she had sent off this letter, which she did early on a splendid\\r\\n\\n\\nmorning of the last days of Indian summer, she felt so hopeful and so\\r\\n\\n\\nlight-hearted, that she longed for a pleasant gossip with some one. So\\r\\n\\n\\nshe rang for her old nurse.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, honey! gracious knows it does me good to see you so chirping!”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid the old woman, dropping cozily into a soft, low chair by the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nurse,” said Drusilla, cautiously approaching the subject that now\\r\\n\\n\\noccupied her thoughts—for she was determined to keep her husband’s name\\r\\n\\n\\nout of the question—“nurse, in all your professional experience did you\\r\\n\\n\\never encounter monomaniacs?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“’Count—_which_, honey? ‘Many money knacks?’ What’s that? tricks to make\\r\\n\\n\\nmoney? No, child, I can’t say as I ever did.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I meant to ask,” said Drusilla, smiling, “if in all your tending of the\\r\\n\\n\\nsick in these many years you ever met with anybody who was mad on one\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject only and sane on all others.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Cracked in one place? Yes, child, many and many a one.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tell me about them.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There was young Rowse Jordan—I mean young Mr. Rowsby Jordan. He had\\r\\n\\n\\ntyphoid fever, and after he got well for ever so long he fancyfied\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself to be a coffee-pot and sat roosted upon the top of the table\\r\\n\\n\\nwith one arm curved around for a handle and the other stuck out straight\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a spout.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How long did the hallucination last?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The—hally—which, honey?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tut! How long did he fancy himself a tea-pot?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Coffee-pot, honey—it was coffee-pot.—Oh, for days and days.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Did he get quite well again?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes, honey, and laughs now at his mad notion, for he ’members all\\r\\n\\n\\nabout it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tell me some more.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, there was a lady patient of my own who would have it her legs was\\r\\n\\n\\nmade of glass, and she kept them propped up against the wall behind the\\r\\n\\n\\nbed and wouldn’t let anybody come near for fear of breaking of ’em.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Was her head right on other things?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As right as yours or mine.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And she got over it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, when she got well.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nurse, tell me—When a person is mad upon one subject, it is no sign\\r\\n\\n\\nthat his mind is unsound, is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“When his brain pan is cracked in one place, you mean?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hi, honey, if a bowl leaks anywheres you can’t call it whole, can you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, no more can’t you call a man’s brain pan sound if it’s\\r\\n\\n\\ncracked ever so little,” argued the old woman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But they get over it. You have proved to me that they get over it,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Drusilla, anxiously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes, they get over it. Bowls and brain pans both may be mended.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nurse, such a monomania is only a temporary affair, like the delirium\\r\\n\\n\\nof fever, is it not? It leaves no after ill effects upon the mind, does\\r\\n\\n\\nit?” she eagerly inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy, who did not quite understand the question, but perceived that her\\r\\n\\n\\npatient was, for some reason or other unknown to her, troubled upon this\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject, hastened to soothe her by replying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lors, no, indeed, honey—not the leastest bit in the world. ’Taint\\r\\n\\n\\nnothink, honey, only somethink to laugh at when it’s all over.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I’m so glad to hear that,” said Drusilla, with a sigh of relief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, honey, if you’ll scuse me, I’ll go down in the kitchen and see\\r\\n\\n\\narter the chicking jelly for your dinner. I know as how that gal, Pina\\r\\n\\n\\n’ll spile it if I leaves it to her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very well, nurse, go.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I ’vises of you, ma’am, to put on your hat and go for a walk in the\\r\\n\\n\\ngarden. It’s right to go out and joy these fine days, which few of ’em\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be left for this season, and if there was you wouldn’t be likely to\\r\\n\\n\\nget the good of ’em.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks, nurse, I think I will take your advice.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd mammy went down to her fancy cooking.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd mammy’s young patient put on her hat and cloak, caught up a little\\r\\n\\n\\nhand-basket and went out and took a turn in the garden among the broad\\r\\n\\n\\nparterres of gorgeous autumn flowers that studded the spacious lawn in\\r\\n\\n\\nfront of the house. She amused herself with carefully gathering the\\r\\n\\n\\nfalling seed and tying up each sort in a separate paper, and putting it\\r\\n\\n\\nin her little basket, for future use.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX.\\r\\n\\n\\n                      DICK HAMMOND IS ASTONISHED.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n  A party of friends, all light-hearted and gay,\\r\\n\\n\\n    At a certain French cafe, where every one goes,\\r\\n\\n\\n  Are met in a well-curtained, warm CABINET,\\r\\n\\n\\n    Overlooking a street there, which every one knows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n  The dinner is done, the Lafitte in its basket,\\r\\n\\n\\n    The champagne in its cooler is passed in gay haste;\\r\\n\\n\\n  Whatever you wish for, you have but to ask it;\\r\\n\\n\\n    Here are coffee, cigars and liqueurs, to your taste.—O. MEREDITH.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile the young, forsaken wife was occupying her lonely hours with these\\r\\n\\n\\nsimple pursuits, and waiting from day to day to hear from her faithless\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband, and hoping against hope to see him, events were transpiring in\\r\\n\\n\\nWashington calculated to have an important influence on her destiny.\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were but trifles in themselves, however momentous in their effects.\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were only a few bachelors’ wine suppers, card parties, and such\\r\\n\\n\\nlike means of ruin. But that fate hangs upon trifles, is a truth as old\\r\\n\\n\\nas the history of Eden lost for an apple.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was the way of it:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter Mr. Richard Hammond had received his final dismissal from Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna Lyon, “that unlucky dog,” as his uncle called him, “fell among\\r\\n\\n\\nthieves.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFELL AMONG THIEVES. That is the best way to characterize his misfortune\\r\\n\\n\\nin sinking again into the society of that dissipated set of men who ate\\r\\n\\n\\nhis dinners, drank his wines, won his money, demoralized his habits and\\r\\n\\n\\ndestroyed his reputation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn a certain evening about this time, poor Dick entertained a few of his\\r\\n\\n\\n“friends” at supper in his rooms, at one of our fashionable hotels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAmong his guests were Captain Reding and Lieutenant Harpe, those two\\r\\n\\n\\ngallant officers of the Loafers’ Guard, who had once affronted Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon by obtruding themselves into his opera box, and afterwards insulted\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla by following her home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA lady friend, whose husband, in his profane bachelor days, had been\\r\\n\\n\\npresent at this orgie, told me something of what passed there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the cloth was removed, and wines, liquors, olives, hookahs, tobacco\\r\\n\\n\\nand cigars were placed upon the table, the “gentlemen” became more than\\r\\n\\n\\never at ease.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe conversation, that had wandered over the general subjects of\\r\\n\\n\\npolitics, field sports, operas, singers’ throats, dancers’ feet and\\r\\n\\n\\nbeauties’ points, now became personal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“By the way, Hammond,” said Captain Reding, taking the mouth-piece of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis hookah from between his lips, and speaking through a cloud of smoke,\\r\\n\\n\\n“I see by the ‘Valley Courier,’ which I found upon your table, that Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon is really going to marry that prig Alexander. Is it quite true?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I believe so, sir,” said Dick, changing color, and helping himself to a\\r\\n\\n\\ndeep draught of cognac.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How the deuce was it that you let the heiress escape you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The heiress, sir? I am not a fortune hunter.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, bosh! you know what I mean, well enough. Who the deuce would ever\\r\\n\\n\\naccuse _you_ of being a fortune hunter?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who, indeed? Fortune lavisher would fit you better! Eh, my boy?” put in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe gentleman who afterwards reported this conversation, and who must\\r\\n\\n\\ntherefore be nameless.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But to return to the previous question,” said Reding, “the previous\\r\\n\\n\\nquestion with an amendment. How was it that you let the beauty elude\\r\\n\\n\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The beauty, sir? I fail to comprehend you,” said Dick, coldly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, bah!” exclaimed young Lieutenant Harpe, rushing recklessly into the\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject, for he was very much the worse for wine. “Why the deuce can’t\\r\\n\\n\\nyou speak out plainly, Cap’, and call people by their names?— Miss Lyon!\\r\\n\\n\\nthe beautiful Miss Lyon! the elegant Miss Lyon! the accomplished Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon! the belle of the season! the queen of the haut ton! the adored of\\r\\n\\n\\nDick Hammond, whom she also adores! the betrothed of Alick Lyon, whom\\r\\n\\n\\nshe abhors! And here’s to her!” And with this, he tossed off a big\\r\\n\\n\\nbumper of brandy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that’s so!” said Reding, “and that being so, why the mischief\\r\\n\\n\\ndon’t you run off with the girl, eh, Hammy, my boy?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNow if Dick had not been drinking a great deal more than was good for\\r\\n\\n\\nhim, he would never have let his cousin’s name come up in such a\\r\\n\\n\\ncompany. Even as it was, he rather resented its introduction now, by\\r\\n\\n\\nkeeping silence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Did you hear me, Hammy, my boy?” persisted Reding. “I asked you\\r\\n\\n\\nwhy—seeing she liked you so much better than she did that rum curse she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas engaged to marry—why you didn’t cut him out and run off with the\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In the first place,” answered Dick, coldly, looking down into his empty\\r\\n\\n\\nglass, “it is not to be presumed possible that the ‘girl,’ as you\\r\\n\\n\\nventured to call the lady, would have consented to run off with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I’d be blown to atoms if I hadn’t kidnapped her!” burst forth\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung Harpe, who was very far gone in inebriation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That would scarcely be practicable in the nineteenth century and in\\r\\n\\n\\nWashington city, Lieutenant,” answered Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No,” laughed Reding; “telegraph wires and detective policemen have been\\r\\n\\n\\nthe death and destruction of all gallant enterprises of that sort.\\r\\n\\n\\nNeither do I think such a violent measure would have been necessary in\\r\\n\\n\\nthis instance. He could have carried her off with her own consent, and\\r\\n\\n\\nnobody on earth could have prevented _that_, as they were both of age.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhy didn’t you do it, my boy, eh? You haven’t answered that question\\r\\n\\n\\nsatisfactorily yet.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because he didn’t dare to!” recklessly interrupted Harpe. “He’s one of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe ‘faint hearts’ that will never ‘win fair lady.’ He didn’t dare to.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will answer you in the words of another weak wretch who was stung by\\r\\n\\n\\nsarcasm into crime:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                ‘I dare do _all_ that may become a man;\\r\\n\\n\\n                Who dares do _more_ is none.’\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn other words, Messieurs, I am quite as incapable of running off with\\r\\n\\n\\nanother man’s betrothed as I should be in making love to another man’s\\r\\n\\n\\nwife,” said Dick, very gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hear! hear! hear!” shouted Harpe; “he wouldn’t run off with another\\r\\n\\n\\nman’s betrothed! oh, no, not he! even when he knows he loves her, and\\r\\n\\n\\nshe him! oh, no! no! sooner than he’d make love to another man’s wife.\\r\\n\\n\\nAs for me, I’d do either, as often as I could get a chance.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, man alive,” said Reding to Dick, “we are not in Spain, nor France,\\r\\n\\n\\nnor Germany, nor any other country where betrothal is held to be almost\\r\\n\\n\\nas sacred as marriage; we are in America, where betrothal means simply a\\r\\n\\n\\nconditional engagement between a young man and young woman to marry each\\r\\n\\n\\nother at a definite or indefinite time, _provided_ in the meanwhile\\r\\n\\n\\nneither party should happen to meet with any one he or she likes better.\\r\\n\\n\\nBosh! such engagements don’t end in marriage once in ten times! Under\\r\\n\\n\\nthe circumstances, I don’t think you were bound to respect the\\r\\n\\n\\nbetrothal.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I differ with you,” said Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As for me,” put in Harpe, defiantly, “I never in all my life fell\\r\\n\\n\\ndesperately in love with a woman, until some other man called my\\r\\n\\n\\nattention to her merits by getting possession of her himself.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You’ll end in getting the sausage meat you call your brains blown out,\\r\\n\\n\\nsome of these days, my fine fellow, if you don’t take care of yourself,”\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed the nameless gentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’d like to know who’s going to do it!” swaggered Harpe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Some indignant husband or lover, of course.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Let ’em try it,” crowed Harpe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think, Hammond,” continued Captain Reding, “common gallantry required\\r\\n\\n\\nyou to try your fortune with that young lady.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I wish, Reding, that you would drop the subject here,” said Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As she never took the least trouble to conceal her preference for you\\r\\n\\n\\nover Lyon, I do not see why we may not discuss the subject here. Why,\\r\\n\\n\\nDick, it was evident to everybody who saw you three together, that she\\r\\n\\n\\nloathed Lyon and liked you. The thing was clear, it was patent, it was\\r\\n\\n\\n_flagrant_, under the circumstances! Now, come, Dick, honor bright! Why\\r\\n\\n\\n_didn’t_ you marry her?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have answered that question already.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Humph! Well! we all thought you would certainly carry off the prize.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhy, you were always following her, hovering over her, waiting on her,\\r\\n\\n\\nand even apparently making love to her, which, by the way, was not very\\r\\n\\n\\nconsistent with your present declaration that you would be incapable of\\r\\n\\n\\nmarrying another man’s betrothed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hear! hear! hear!” shouted young Harpe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is so,” frankly confessed Dick. “It is true that I sunned myself\\r\\n\\n\\ntoo much in the light of that bright lady’s smiles. It was the old, old\\r\\n\\n\\nstory of the moth and the flame. But no one was hurt except myself. I\\r\\n\\n\\nwas smartly singed. I should, perhaps, have been entirely consumed but\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a mercifully severe hand that took me away from the fatal light and\\r\\n\\n\\nwarmth of the flame, and put me out in the cold and dark. And so—saved\\r\\n\\n\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd, saying this, Dick lighted his hookah and withdrew into a cloud of\\r\\n\\n\\nincense.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, Dick, talk prose, not poetry. We’re a practical party here, we\\r\\n\\n\\nare! The mercifully severe hand that took you away from the fire and put\\r\\n\\n\\nyou out in the cold, was no other than the fair lady’s hand that\\r\\n\\n\\ntendered you the traditional mitten. I thought so!” laughed Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; it was the war-worn hand of a veteran soldier. My uncle had me up\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore him one morning; actually arraigned me in the most magisterial\\r\\n\\n\\nmanner; set Alick’s rights, Anna’s duties, and my own trespasses\\r\\n\\n\\nsquarely before me, and then appealed to my honor; to which, I need not\\r\\n\\n\\nsay, Messieurs, no one ever yet appealed in vain. I have never seen my\\r\\n\\n\\nfair cousin since that day.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Quite right, Hammond. I honor your principles,” said the nameless\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ume-me-me!” groaned young Harpe, rising sanctimoniously. “My brethren,\\r\\n\\n\\nlet us _awle_ unite in prayer.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hold your profane tongue, sir,” said Captain Reding, pushing the mocker\\r\\n\\n\\ndown into his seat. “And don’t drink any more brandy! You’re crazy now.\\r\\n\\n\\nYou’ll be under the table presently.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sober as any man here,” laughed Harpe, dropping into his chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Appealed to your honor, did he, Hammond?” said Reding, turning to Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I suppose the word has some meaning for you and for the gallant\\r\\n\\n\\nold gentleman. But I wonder how Alick Lyon understands honor, and how he\\r\\n\\n\\nreconciles it with his present course.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“His present course. What do you mean?” inquired Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I should have said the course he has pursued the whole winter.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What was that? I don’t like Lyon. I can not now. I all but hate him.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut, still, I do not think him capable of doing anything dishonorable.\\r\\n\\n\\nHe is too proud to do so, for one thing,” said Alick’s generous foe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, may be so. But I’d like to know what his ideas of honor are; or\\r\\n\\n\\nhow he can _honorably_ reconcile his position in respect to Miss Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nwith his relations to the little beauty at Cedarwood.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘The little beauty at Cedarwood!’” echoed Dick, in astonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, little Drusa!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Little Drusa—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, now, Dick, don’t you be Forestic, Murdochic, Wallackic, or tragic\\r\\n\\n\\nafter any of these schools. They’re not in your line. So leave off\\r\\n\\n\\nechoing my words and staring at me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But you said something about a girl that he has got hidden away at\\r\\n\\n\\nCedarwood?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I did.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t believe it!” said Dick, bluntly. Then remembering that he was\\r\\n\\n\\nthe host speaking to his guest, he courteously added: “You are mistaken,\\r\\n\\n\\nsir. Lyon, with all his faults, is not a villain.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who said he was? I didn’t. All I say is, that he has got just the\\r\\n\\n\\nsweetest little beauty you ever saw in your life cozily concealed in a\\r\\n\\n\\npretty cottage orneé at Cedarwood. And he is very fond of her, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nis entirely devoted to him; and he calls her sweet love, and little\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusa. And she is just the loveliest little creature the sun ever shone\\r\\n\\n\\nupon, with a clear pale face, and lustrous dark hair and eyes, of such\\r\\n\\n\\nunfathomable depths of passion and of thought that she might well be\\r\\n\\n\\nsupposed to be from the East, and be a daughter of the Druses.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Are you _sure_ of this?” asked Dick, with emphasis.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’ll swear to it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Who_ is she then?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! that I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_What_ is she to him?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can’t undertake to say. I’ll swear that this little beauty is living\\r\\n\\n\\nunder his protection in his house at Cedarwood. But whether she is his\\r\\n\\n\\nwife, or his sister, or his mother, or his maiden aunt, of course, I\\r\\n\\n\\ncan’t tell. Doubtless it is some highly respectable connection of that\\r\\n\\n\\nsort, Mr. Alexander Lyon being master of the house. If it was _you_,\\r\\n\\n\\nDick, you see we should all know what to think!” laughed Captain Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick Hammond had been gazing steadily into the face of the speaker, and\\r\\n\\n\\nrubbing his own brows very thoughtfully and occasionally frowning\\r\\n\\n\\npainfully. But now he suddenly started up, struck his hand upon his\\r\\n\\n\\nforehead, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good Heaven! It must be Drusilla Sterling!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Humph! Forestic again! You know her then?” said Captain Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Know her? I’ve known her from childhood. Poor little thing! So this is\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat became of her!” said Dick, in a voice of great pain, as he dropped\\r\\n\\n\\ndejectedly into his seat again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How look here, you know; none of that! Don’t you be gettin’ up any\\r\\n\\n\\ninterest in her; because, you see, I’ve made up my own mind that way.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when Lyon marries I mean to take the pretty cottage and the pretty\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl both off his hands,” drawled Harpe, very drowsily, for he was in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe last stage of intoxication, and almost asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You can so well afford that sort of thing, with your lieutenant’s pay!”\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed “nameless.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who is this girl, Dick, since you know her?” inquired Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She is as pure and good a girl as lives in this world. And, gentlemen,\\r\\n\\n\\nif she is at Cedarwood, as you say, under Alick’s protection, my life\\r\\n\\n\\nand soul on it, she is his wife, or she believes herself to be such!”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Dick, earnestly and almost angrily, as if he challenged even the\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughts of men if they wronged the friendless girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNo one seemed disposed to contradict him in words, no matter how much\\r\\n\\n\\nthey may have differed from him in opinion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But who is she then, Hammond?” persisted Captain Reding, who never, if\\r\\n\\n\\nhe could help it, left a point unsettled.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla Sterling, a clergyman’s orphan; brought up in Alexander Lyon’s\\r\\n\\n\\nfamily; a protegée of his mother, a pet of his father. Little less than\\r\\n\\n\\na year ago she disappeared from her home, and could never be traced by\\r\\n\\n\\nher friends. So she is with him, the hypocritical scoundrel! But she is\\r\\n\\n\\nhis wife, or thinks herself so! My life and soul on it, she does, for\\r\\n\\n\\nshe could not fall—she could not. I have known her from her earliest\\r\\n\\n\\nchildhood—the sweetest child that ever lived—a little saint!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But are you sure she is the same with Alick’s girl?” inquired Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I fear there is no doubt of it. The coincidence of name and\\r\\n\\n\\ncircumstance is so complete. I can’t think why I didn’t recognize her\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen you first mentioned her; though in truth I never heard her called\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusa, but Drusilla; and I never thought of her as a woman, but merely\\r\\n\\n\\nas a child, and most certainly couldn’t associate her memory with any\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughts of license, but always with the most sacred sanctities of\\r\\n\\n\\nhome.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Were you her lover in the past as you are her champion in the present,\\r\\n\\n\\nHammond?” laughed Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No—yes—I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Clear, to the point, and satisfactory, that answer!” laughed the\\r\\n\\n\\ncaptain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I mean to say that I loved her, but not in the sense you mean. I loved\\r\\n\\n\\nher only as a great New Foundland dog might love a baby; as a big brute\\r\\n\\n\\nlike myself might love such a little angel as she was,” said Dick,\\r\\n\\n\\ngravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, all women are angels until they are—found out!” mused\\r\\n\\n\\nLieutenant Harpe, rousing himself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What did you say, sir?” coolly inquired Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I say,” defiantly answered Harpe, “that all women are angels until they\\r\\n\\n\\nare found out, and then they are fallen angels, every one of ’em!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Speak for the women you know best, sir! for those you have been brought\\r\\n\\n\\nup with; for those you associate with; for those nearest and dearest to\\r\\n\\n\\nyou. For, _of course_, of them only _can_ you speak from knowledge! As\\r\\n\\n\\nfor me, I judge a man and his family by his judgment of women. He who\\r\\n\\n\\ntraduces the sex defames his own mother—and his sisters, wife, and\\r\\n\\n\\ndaughters if he has them!” said Dick, indignantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nInstead of attempting a reply to this scathing rebuke, the weak traducer\\r\\n\\n\\nof woman looked around on his companions, with a tipsy smile, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwinking knowingly, said: “_I_ don’t mind _him_, bless you! _He_ don’t\\r\\n\\n\\nknow what he’s talking about; he’s _tight_—tight as ever he can be! He\\r\\n\\n\\nwants to quarrel now; he’s always quarrelsome in his cups!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd having delivered himself of this opinion, he crossed his arms upon\\r\\n\\n\\nthe table, dropped his head upon them, and resigned himself to sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Poor Harpe, he has a very weak brain,” said Captain Reding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNo one else made any comment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Reding,” said Dick Hammond, turning to the captain, “I want you to tell\\r\\n\\n\\nme how you discovered the residence of this poor girl at Cedarwood.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, you see we first saw her with him at the opera. It was quite early\\r\\n\\n\\nin the season, and they were in a private box. Harpe and I were in the\\r\\n\\n\\norchestra seats. When the curtain fell on the first act we went around\\r\\n\\n\\nthere to get a nearer view of the pretty creature, hoping also to get an\\r\\n\\n\\nintroduction to her. But Lord bless you, Lyon scowled at us as if he\\r\\n\\n\\nthought we had come to pick his pockets. We wouldn’t take notice of his\\r\\n\\n\\nblack looks, but by being perfectly civil and self-possessed ourselves\\r\\n\\n\\nwe compelled him to treat us with something like courtesy. But it was\\r\\n\\n\\n_only_ something-like; it wasn’t the genuine article itself; for he\\r\\n\\n\\nwouldn’t ask us to sit down, nor he wouldn’t present us to the pretty\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl. And from that day I don’t think he ever brought her into the city\\r\\n\\n\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then how did you discover her residence and her relations to him?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am going to tell you. Some days after that we met Lyon in the\\r\\n\\n\\nreading-room of the Brown House. We chaffed him about the mysterious\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle beauty, you may be sure. But he stopped us by telling us that she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas the daughter of a clergyman, and was only passing through the city\\r\\n\\n\\nunder his escort, and that she had returned to her home in the country.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A mere evasion, of course.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; but we did not question the fact at the time; although we did\\r\\n\\n\\nwonder how Alick come to be trusted with the escort of a young lady.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I should think so. Pray go on.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A little later we discovered the truth by chance. I went to spend a few\\r\\n\\n\\ndays with an acquaintance I have living about a mile from Cedarwood. And\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile there, guided by some negroes, I went on a coon-hunt by\\r\\n\\n\\ntorch-light. Did you ever see a coon-hunt by torch-light?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Often, when I was a boy; never since.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, the sport was quite new to me, and as a natural consequence I got\\r\\n\\n\\nseparated from the dogs and darkies, and got lost in the woods.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A good beginning for an adventure,” said the nameless gentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes. Well, to resume—while I was trying to find a path, I saw a bright,\\r\\n\\n\\nindeed a brilliant light, shining through the trees at some distance. I\\r\\n\\n\\nwent towards it, and found a beautiful cottage ornée, with its front\\r\\n\\n\\nwindows splendidly illuminated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There was a party,” said one of the guests.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; though as it was now between two and three o’clock in the morning,\\r\\n\\n\\non seeing the lighted windows I was struck with the same thought. They\\r\\n\\n\\nare having a blow out in there, I said to myself. But it was nothing of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe kind, my friends!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What was it, then?” inquired Dick, anxiously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wait till I tell you. I pushed on towards the house, and when I came up\\r\\n\\n\\nto it, I saw no carriages, no servants, no life, no motion. Everything\\r\\n\\n\\nwas as still as death. In fact, the whole house was closed up except the\\r\\n\\n\\ntwo brilliantly illumined windows, from which the light streamed far\\r\\n\\n\\nacross the lawn, and deep into the woods.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Go on! go on!” said Reding’s companions, speaking in a chorus. And the\\r\\n\\n\\ncaptain, who had only paused to take a drink, continued:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Well,’ I said to myself, ‘this is rum go, anyway!’ And after walking\\r\\n\\n\\naround and around the pretty place, without seeing or hearing anything,\\r\\n\\n\\nI just climbed up to the window-sill and peeped through the lighted\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere the captain paused for pure aggravation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well! well! what did you see?” exclaimed several voices.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What did I see? Ah, my friends, I had a full view of a small\\r\\n\\n\\nterrestrial paradise! and a beautiful mortal houri! a little domestic\\r\\n\\n\\nEden, with a sweet little Eve within it! an enchanted bower, with a\\r\\n\\n\\nsleeping beauty!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do speak plainly, Reding! that’s a good fellow!” said the nameless\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, I saw a nice, cozy drawing-room, the very picture of\\r\\n\\n\\nelegance and comfort; a fine fire of sea coal in the grate; a luxurious\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle supper set forth in a splendid service on a round marble table;\\r\\n\\n\\nby its side an easy chair, and a pair of slippers; at a short distance\\r\\n\\n\\nand nearer the chimney corner a little stand, with an astral lamp and\\r\\n\\n\\nsome books; and near it a lovely young creature, reclining in a resting\\r\\n\\n\\nchair, fast asleep, with the book she had been reading fallen upon her\\r\\n\\n\\nlap.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What a beautiful picture,” said one of the company, while the others\\r\\n\\n\\nlistened in silence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I immediately recognized the beauty of the opera box; but as I live,\\r\\n\\n\\ngentlemen, I did not then connect her in my thoughts with Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon. On the contrary, I believed his account of her, and I said to\\r\\n\\n\\nmyself—‘There is the little darling waiting up for her clerical papa,\\r\\n\\n\\nwho has gone to make a pastoral call on some one of his parishioners who\\r\\n\\n\\nis dying.’ And I hung there by the sill of the window, and looked in and\\r\\n\\n\\nfed my eyes upon the sweetness of the scene.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well? what then?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I heard horse’s feet coming. ‘Papa is returning,’ I said to\\r\\n\\n\\nmyself. And I dropped from the sill and hid myself in some thick bushes\\r\\n\\n\\nbelow it, to wait till papa should pass, so that I might make my retreat\\r\\n\\n\\nunobserved. It appears that the horseman went first around to the\\r\\n\\n\\nstable; for soon I heard rapid footsteps approaching the house. And you\\r\\n\\n\\nmay judge my surprise when I saw a young man run lightly up the stairs,\\r\\n\\n\\nand saw the door fly open, letting out a flood of light, and the little\\r\\n\\n\\nbeauty rush into the arms of the new comer, whom I then plainly\\r\\n\\n\\nrecognized as Alexander Lyon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Great Heaven!” exclaimed Dick Hammond, in agitation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“As if it had not been enough to know him by his face and form, I had\\r\\n\\n\\nhis voice also in evidence of his identity. ‘Are you as glad to see me\\r\\n\\n\\nas all this, my little Drusa?’ he asked. And she answered with a shower\\r\\n\\n\\nof soft caresses and silvery tones.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And then?” inquired Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, then, of course, the house swallowed them up. The door was shut\\r\\n\\n\\nand locked, and the brilliant windows were darkened, and they had their\\r\\n\\n\\nhappiness all to themselves, while I was left out in the cold.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You could not have been mistaken in what you supposed you saw and\\r\\n\\n\\nheard?” inquired Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; how could I? That was not the only time I looked in at those\\r\\n\\n\\nwindows either. A sort of fascination drew me there, to look in upon\\r\\n\\n\\nthat lovely young creature. While I remained in the neighborhood, under\\r\\n\\n\\nthe cover of coon hunting, I paid a visit to the lighted windows every\\r\\n\\n\\nnight. Ah! night after night! night after night did that sweet little\\r\\n\\n\\ncreature sit there waiting for him, leaving the windows open to guide\\r\\n\\n\\nhim home, and keeping his supper warm, while he, sorry dog, was engaged\\r\\n\\n\\ngallanting Miss Anna about to balls and theatres, and scowling at better\\r\\n\\n\\nmen than himself if they so much as looked at the belle.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Reding, I am deeply grieved to hear this; scarcely less so than I\\r\\n\\n\\nshould be if the poor child were my own sister. But I repeat and\\r\\n\\n\\nreiterate most emphatically this truth, that she is really his wife, or\\r\\n\\n\\nbelieves herself to be so!” said Dick, earnestly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think you are quite right, Hammond! The young creature herself, and\\r\\n\\n\\nall her surroundings breathed so sweetly of what you called ‘the\\r\\n\\n\\nsanctities of home life’ that no one looking on her could think evil of\\r\\n\\n\\nher. Indeed I thought evil of _myself_ though, sometimes, for seeming to\\r\\n\\n\\nplay the spy. But I couldn’t resist the temptation of looking into that\\r\\n\\n\\nbeautiful interior. I meant no harm.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And your contraband pastime was never discovered?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh yes,” laughed Reding. “She rose once and turned round so suddenly,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she saw me before I could drop from my perch. She screamed and\\r\\n\\n\\ndisappeared; and I could have scourged myself for frightening her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And then, I suppose, your stolen visits ceased.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not a bit of it. I was only more cautious. But one night I purposely\\r\\n\\n\\nlet myself be seen by _him_, on a rare occasion, when he happened to\\r\\n\\n\\ncome home before daylight. It was to be my last visit, for I was about\\r\\n\\n\\nto leave the neighborhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Did he know you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No! for as soon as he got a glimpse of my face, he blazed away at me\\r\\n\\n\\nwith his revolver, and you may rest assured, I didn’t stop to claim his\\r\\n\\n\\nacquaintance! All, he had a good chase after me, and I had a good run\\r\\n\\n\\nand a good laugh! When I returned to the city, I couldn’t keep the joke\\r\\n\\n\\nto myself. I had to tell Harpe, for which I was afterwards sorry; for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe scurvy fellow, with a party of his companions, having met the poor\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle girl in the city after Lyon had left, took advantage of her\\r\\n\\n\\nunprotected state and followed her home, and would have intruded into\\r\\n\\n\\nher house, if they had not been prevented by her servants.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Reding,” said Dick, gravely, “after what I have told you of this young\\r\\n\\n\\nlady, I hope and trust that you will abstain from speaking of her\\r\\n\\n\\nanywhere, and from doing anything to annoy her at any time. In a word, I\\r\\n\\n\\nappeal to your manhood, to treat her in all respects as you would treat\\r\\n\\n\\nthe most honored woman of your acquaintance.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I never wished to do otherwise, and as I never expect to see the little\\r\\n\\n\\nangel again, I shall never have a chance of doing otherwise. But here, I\\r\\n\\n\\ndeclare, the day is breaking! And we ought to do the same! Wake up,\\r\\n\\n\\nHarpe! Come! Good night, Hammond!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so the party separated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick Hammond remained, walking up and down the room in deep thought. At\\r\\n\\n\\nlength he took a sudden resolution—to seek Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XL.\\r\\n\\n\\n                              DICK’S NEWS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           If Sorrow has taught me anything,\\r\\n\\n\\n             She has taught me to weep for you,\\r\\n\\n\\n           If falsehood has left me a tear to shed\\r\\n\\n\\n             For Truth, those tears are true.—OWEN MEREDITH.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe greenness of the grass, the freshness of the flowers, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nsplendor of the sunshine, still lingered; the glorious Indian summer\\r\\n\\n\\nstill lived on through the gorgeous month of October, and even staid to\\r\\n\\n\\nwelcome the arrival of sad November.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt high noon, one day about this time, Drusilla was sauntering slowly\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough her garden, trying to gather strength and comfort from the\\r\\n\\n\\nbeauty and refulgence of the scene and hour, when she suddenly heard the\\r\\n\\n\\nouter gate open.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe looked up to see the cause, and she started violently and changed\\r\\n\\n\\ncolor; for she saw—\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Richard Hammond!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was now walking up the avenue towards the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn seeing him, her first natural emotion was that of astonishment; her\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst clear impression was that he came from her husband on some errand\\r\\n\\n\\nto herself. All in a tumult of delight, she hastened to meet him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Alexander Lyon, I believe,” said Dick, at a hazard, and\\r\\n\\n\\nrespectfully raising his hat as he came on to greet her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that is my now name,” answered the young matron, with a smile and\\r\\n\\n\\na blush of happiness, not of confusion, as the questioner particularly\\r\\n\\n\\nnoticed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I knew it!” he exclaimed, emphatically and involuntarily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Knew what? knew me?” she inquired, pleasantly. “Of course you did. Why\\r\\n\\n\\nshould you not? It has been but two years since we met. And I knew YOU\\r\\n\\n\\nat a glance.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very likely; for an old fellow like myself does not change in two\\r\\n\\n\\nyears, while a young lady like you grows up and gets married in the\\r\\n\\n\\nmeantime, which makes _some_ little difference,” answered Dick, archly,\\r\\n\\n\\npartly to cover his confusion at having spoken his thoughts aloud, and\\r\\n\\n\\npartly to procure her confirmation of what he firmly believed—namely,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she truly or falsely imagined herself to be a wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” she replied, still blushing and smiling, “I am married; and\\r\\n\\n\\nas you know that fact, which you could have learned only from my\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband, of course you come from him. He is well?” she inquired, anxiety\\r\\n\\n\\nnow betraying itself in her look and tone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Quite well,” said Dick, who was now beginning to feel the embarrassment\\r\\n\\n\\nof the duty he had taken upon himself to do.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And you bring me a letter from him? I have been looking for one by the\\r\\n\\n\\nmail; but I am glad he sent it by you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick hesitated and looked confused.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Give me my letter, please,” she said, holding out her hand with a\\r\\n\\n\\nsmile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear Mrs. Lyon, I regret to say I have no letter for you,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered, as calmly as he could.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No letter!” she repeated, with a look of disappointment; and she sank\\r\\n\\n\\ndown in the garden seat, because from excess of emotion she was unable\\r\\n\\n\\nto stand. Then, soon brightening up with new hope, she exclaimed—“Oh,\\r\\n\\n\\nthen, he has charged you with a message for me! Sit down here and tell\\r\\n\\n\\nme all he says.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick took the offered seat, but remained silent.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How, then, Mr. Hammond, tell me! tell me quickly what does Alick say?\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd, oh, forgive my impatience! but it has been so long since I have\\r\\n\\n\\nheard from my husband, and I have been so uneasy about him!” she said,\\r\\n\\n\\nand her hurried tones, her eager face and trembling frame, all betrayed\\r\\n\\n\\nthe excess of anxiety that agitated her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Dick Hammond sat silent and immovable, cursing the fate that had\\r\\n\\n\\nthrust upon him a duty he found so hard to perform.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why don’t you answer me? Why are you silent? Why do you look so\\r\\n\\n\\nstrangely, avoiding my eyes? What is the matter? Oh, Heaven, what has\\r\\n\\n\\nhappened?” she cried, turning pale and beginning to twist her fingers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Lyon,” said Dick, with an effort, “I have neither letter nor\\r\\n\\n\\nmessage from Alexander.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Neither letter nor message from my husband? I thought you came from\\r\\n\\n\\nhim! I thought you came with his sanction. Else why are you here at\\r\\n\\n\\nall?” she asked, shivering with a vague alarm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madam!” cried Dick, jumping up, flushing red, and, between his pity for\\r\\n\\n\\nher and his rage at Alick, losing all his self-command; “Madam, I came\\r\\n\\n\\nhere to tell you that Alexander Lyon is a reproach to his name and to\\r\\n\\n\\nmanhood! and totally unworthy of your regard, or of the notice of any\\r\\n\\n\\nhonest woman!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla was struck dumb.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor a few moments she gazed at him in blank wonder, while he strode up\\r\\n\\n\\nand down the garden walk before her, wiping his brows and trying to\\r\\n\\n\\nsubdue his excitement. Then she arose slowly, stretched out her arm, and\\r\\n\\n\\npointing to the outer gate said, quietly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leave this place, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe stopped in his furious walk and looked at her. She had ceased to\\r\\n\\n\\nspeak, but was still standing pale and grim and pointing his way out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe felt that he must keep his ground, and do his duty at any cost. He\\r\\n\\n\\nwas sorry that his own rashness had raised obstacles in his path. He\\r\\n\\n\\napproached her and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madam, I take back my words. I beg your pardon for having uttered them.\\r\\n\\n\\nI will beg it on my bent knee to content you. Forgive me, and consider\\r\\n\\n\\nmy rash words unsaid.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, I know not how to forgive you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But when penitence is professed and forgiveness asked, it is a\\r\\n\\n\\nChristian’s duty to extend it,” said Dick, appealing to her conscience.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Admit, then, that your words—the injurious epithets you dared to apply\\r\\n\\n\\nto my husband—were untrue.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do _you_, who have so much trust in him, need to be assured that they\\r\\n\\n\\nwere untrue?” inquired Dick, evasively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, indeed, I do not. I know that Alexander Lyon is the very soul of\\r\\n\\n\\nhonor.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick bowed deeply and a little ironically, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But you require a fuller apology than I have yet made?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I make it. I feel very sorry that I forgot myself so far as to\\r\\n\\n\\nuse those terms in respect to the gentleman in question. I take them\\r\\n\\n\\nback unreservedly, and I beg you, as you are a Christian, to forgive\\r\\n\\n\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe bowed, still a little coldly, and then said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, I know that you have come here this morning, if not directly from\\r\\n\\n\\nmy husband, at least in his interests, or upon his affairs. If you are\\r\\n\\n\\nan authorized agent, pray explain the nature of the business that has\\r\\n\\n\\nbrought you here.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUnder the forced calmness of her words he perceived that a terrible\\r\\n\\n\\nanxiety was torturing her soul. He answered gently:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Madam, yes, I come here on his affairs and in his interests, since it\\r\\n\\n\\nis certainly important to him that he be prevented from taking a certain\\r\\n\\n\\nstep that he contemplates.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What step is that?” she breathlessly inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will you permit me first to see you into the house? The explanation I\\r\\n\\n\\nhave to make is not a pleasant one, and you are already something\\r\\n\\n\\novercome by what has passed. You had better hear the rest of what I have\\r\\n\\n\\nto say in your own parlor.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla hesitated. She still resented the words he had used in\\r\\n\\n\\nreference to her husband, although he had recanted and begged pardon;\\r\\n\\n\\nand for this reason she shrank from taking him across the threshold of\\r\\n\\n\\nher house. But she reflected that, as he had assured her he came upon\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander’s affairs and in his interests, she could do no less than open\\r\\n\\n\\nher doors to his entrance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, then,” she said, rising and leading the way into the cottage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe walked very fast, her impatience overcoming her weariness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe showed him into the drawing-room and signed him into a seat, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsank herself down on a corner of the sofa, for she was quite out of\\r\\n\\n\\nbreath.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, now, Mr. Hammond,” she exclaimed, as soon as she could articulate\\r\\n\\n\\nthe words. “Explain yourself! I know well, I knew from the first, that\\r\\n\\n\\nyou did not come here for the sole purpose of making me a call. I feel\\r\\n\\n\\nnow that the nature of your errand is painful. Tell it at once. You must\\r\\n\\n\\nknow that anything is better than suspense.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick attempted to answer, but looked in her face and failed. It was as\\r\\n\\n\\nhard to obey her as it would have been to gaze in the eyes of a lamb and\\r\\n\\n\\nslay it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Still silent?” she said, clasping her hands. “Ah, Heaven, do not\\r\\n\\n\\ntorture me so! I have suffered so much already! so much, just Lord! I\\r\\n\\n\\ncan bear no more! Tell me your worst news at once, and kill me with it.\\r\\n\\n\\nIt would be mercy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStill, still, Dick’s answer, like Macbeth’s amen, “stuck in his throat.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Heaven, what is this? Why don’t you speak? Alick! Alick! my\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband! You said that he was well! Yes, you said so! But they say of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe _dead_ that they are well!” she cried, clasping her hands, and in\\r\\n\\n\\nher excessive alarm forgetting that Dick had certainly, in the early\\r\\n\\n\\npart of their interview, spoken of Alick as a living man about to take\\r\\n\\n\\nan objectionable step.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer complexion curdled into white and livid spots, her features quivered\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the intense agony of suspense, as she stretched out her hands and\\r\\n\\n\\ngasped forth the word:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tell—tell—is Alick—DEAD?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No!” thundered Dick, emphatically, as he found his voice, “he is not!\\r\\n\\n\\nNo such good luck. The rope is not ready for him yet,” he added, under\\r\\n\\n\\nhis breath.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe heard only the first words of his reply.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank Heaven for that, at least. It is well to know that. I think now I\\r\\n\\n\\ncan bear everything else,” she sighed, as the tension of her nerves\\r\\n\\n\\nrelaxed, and she sank down among the cushions and closed her eyes. This\\r\\n\\n\\nreaction from her illogical but deadly terror was so great, that she\\r\\n\\n\\nnearly swooned. And now to feel certain that he was alive and well\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed all sufficient for her satisfaction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick did not disturb her by a word, look, or gesture. He was pleased to\\r\\n\\n\\nput off the evil hour of explanation as long as possible, even if it\\r\\n\\n\\nwere to be forever; and he mentally bemoaned the hardship of the duty he\\r\\n\\n\\nfelt compelled to do, and he wished himself anywhere else but where he\\r\\n\\n\\nwas.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn a few minutes Drusilla recovered herself, and with an effort sat up\\r\\n\\n\\nand said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Hammond, you assure me that my husband is alive and well; as indeed\\r\\n\\n\\nI ought to have known from your previous conversation; only that in my\\r\\n\\n\\nsudden alarm I did not remember it. I am not very rational, I think. But\\r\\n\\n\\nnow that my fears for his safety are set at rest, I do not dread to hear\\r\\n\\n\\nany other ill news that you may have to tell me. So speak out freely and\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout fear for me. I am strong enough to sustain the shock of common\\r\\n\\n\\ncalamities,” she added, with a smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in saying these words, she only thought of Mr. Lyon’s supposed\\r\\n\\n\\nlawsuit, “connected with his late father’s will,” and she fancied that\\r\\n\\n\\nDick had come to tell her of its failure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I will do so, Mrs. Lyon—Drusilla! I wish you would let me call you\\r\\n\\n\\nso, as I used to do when you were a little child,” said Dick, gently and\\r\\n\\n\\ngravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You may call me anything that my husband will permit, Mr. Hammond. But\\r\\n\\n\\nuntil you have his sanction, you must call me Mrs. Lyon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, my dear child,” said Dick, mournfully, “I fear that is the very\\r\\n\\n\\nlast name he will be willing to accord you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is it that you say, sir? What do you mean?” questioned Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nin a low, breathless, hurried tone, as with his words there rushed upon\\r\\n\\n\\nher mind the recollection of her husband’s cruel letter, in which he had\\r\\n\\n\\ndeclared his union with her to be illegal, null and void, and to have\\r\\n\\n\\nalways been so. And now she instantly connected Hammond’s visit and his\\r\\n\\n\\nuntold news with that letter and its cruel communications. And she\\r\\n\\n\\nwondered if Dick knew anything about Alick’s supposed monomania; and if\\r\\n\\n\\nso, whether he rightly understood it, or whether he was misled by it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs Dick did not immediately answer her questions, she spoke to him\\r\\n\\n\\nagain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why do you not reply to me, Mr. Hammond?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, my poor child! my dear child! you readily surmised that I had\\r\\n\\n\\npainful matters to communicate, but you never divined how painful,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nDick, sorrowfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You alarm me again. For Heaven’s sake, speak and shorten this torture,”\\r\\n\\n\\nshe pleaded.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You believe yourself to be the wife of Alexander Lyon?” said Dick,\\r\\n\\n\\nmodulating his voice to a tone of the deepest and most respectful\\r\\n\\n\\nsympathy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘_Believe_,’ sir? I am so,” answered Drusilla, drawing herself up with\\r\\n\\n\\na proud and confident smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I feel assured that you think as you say. My long knowledge of you, my\\r\\n\\n\\nearnest esteem for you will not permit me to question your good faith.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut my poor Drusilla, my dear girl, I fear, I greatly fear that you are\\r\\n\\n\\nmistaken.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am not, sir. I cannot be mistaken on such a subject,” answered\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla. And as all the deep dishonor implied in the doubt rushed over\\r\\n\\n\\nher mind, her face and neck were suffused with the crimson flush of\\r\\n\\n\\nwounded delicacy and offended pride, and she added, “You must know, sir,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat to question my wifehood is to insult me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Heaven is my witness, how far from my heart is the wish to offend you,\\r\\n\\n\\nhow profound and respectful is my sympathy for you, and how deeply it\\r\\n\\n\\npains me to give you pain. But I must do my duty. Most willingly would I\\r\\n\\n\\nhave avoided this task, if I could have done so; but I could not. And I\\r\\n\\n\\ncome to serve and to save you, and one who is dearer to me than all\\r\\n\\n\\nothers besides,” said Dick, earnestly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think I know why you speak to me in this manner. You have suffered\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself to be misled by the transient imaginings of a monomaniac, who\\r\\n\\n\\nis so sane on all other subjects, and with one exception so strong and\\r\\n\\n\\nclear in judgment and understanding, that you have failed to discover\\r\\n\\n\\nhis hallucination to be what it is. But I will soon convince you that it\\r\\n\\n\\nis _you_ who are mistaken, and not I,” replied Drusilla, with much\\r\\n\\n\\ndignity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she drew from her bosom the little black silk bag:, took from it the\\r\\n\\n\\nsmall piece of paper and placed it in the hands of her visitor, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There, Mr. Hammond, read that, and confess that you have alarmed\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself for nothing.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick, who had been listening to her and watching her in wonder and\\r\\n\\n\\ncuriosity, took the paper, and with a bow, began to examine it. As he\\r\\n\\n\\nread it slowly and attentively, he gathered his brows into a thoughtful\\r\\n\\n\\nand troubled frown, and as he finished it, he looked at her with a\\r\\n\\n\\ncompassionate expression and inquired:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear child, how came this little document into your keeping?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I found it while clearing out Alick’s dressing-glass drawer. And as it\\r\\n\\n\\nwas as much mine as his, and as he did not seem to set much value on it,\\r\\n\\n\\njudging by the place in which he left it, I took possession of it. And I\\r\\n\\n\\nam very glad now that I have it to show you,” she answered, smiling\\r\\n\\n\\nconfidently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because you consider it a proof positive of your marriage?” he\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired, gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, of course. And so it is,” she exclaimed, triumphantly. “Why, look\\r\\n\\n\\nat it! Read it! It is quite plain and conclusive! A child could\\r\\n\\n\\ncomprehend it! Don’t you see for yourself that this is the most positive\\r\\n\\n\\nproof of my marriage that could possibly be produced?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Drusilla,” he answered, mournfully, “I see nothing of the sort.\\r\\n\\n\\nQuite the contrary.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then you don’t understand English when you see it!” retorted the sorely\\r\\n\\n\\ntried young creature, losing a little of her saintly patience.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I understand _this_, but too well!” replied Dick, grimly regarding the\\r\\n\\n\\ndocument that he still held in his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In mercy’s name, what do you mean now?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I mean that this piece of paper proves no marriage. It only indicates\\r\\n\\n\\nthat at the time of its being filled out, Lyon probably had sincere\\r\\n\\n\\nintention to marry you. But so far from its being a proof of your\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage, as it lies here before us, it affords an incontrovertible\\r\\n\\n\\nevidence that no such marriage ever took place!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come! what next, I wonder? Are you also a monomaniac on this subject?\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd is madness infectious? If so, pray leave my presence before you\\r\\n\\n\\ninoculate me with the same mania!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I would to Heaven that you were right and that I were talking at\\r\\n\\n\\nrandom! But it is not so, Drusilla! ‘I speak the words of truth and\\r\\n\\n\\nsoberness.’ This document proves that you were never married,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nHammond, with as much earnestness as sadness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are raving! In the name of reason how can you talk so frantically?\\r\\n\\n\\n_That_ paper, of all things in the world, proves I never was married?\\r\\n\\n\\nCan _any_ thing in the universe prove that I was never married, when I\\r\\n\\n\\nknow I was? I am not a fool, or a lunatic, or a visionary, to imagine\\r\\n\\n\\nthings that never happened. I saw and heard myself married to Alick by a\\r\\n\\n\\nregularly ordained minister, with a special license, and in the presence\\r\\n\\n\\nof a dozen witnesses. You talk wildly, Mr. Hammond! Yes, and very\\r\\n\\n\\noffensively!” she added.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I beg you to forgive me and to bear with me, Drusilla,” he answered\\r\\n\\n\\nsadly, “but——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Call me by my husband’s name! I have a right to it!” interrupted the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung matron, proudly, but mournfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Heaven knows that you _have_ a right to it! The holiest, if not\\r\\n\\n\\nthe most lawful right, and I cannot refuse it to you. But, Mrs. Lyon, as\\r\\n\\n\\nI told you, I came here to serve and to save _you_ if possible, and also\\r\\n\\n\\none who is dearest of all to me; so in her service and in yours, I must\\r\\n\\n\\nconvince you of the truth of what I have just said, however distressing\\r\\n\\n\\nit may be for me to press, or for you to believe,” said Dick, solemnly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe earnestness and solemnity of his words deeply impressed her. A new\\r\\n\\n\\nterror struck all the color from her face—doubt, like the iron, entered\\r\\n\\n\\nher soul. She gazed at him transfixed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is so,” said Hammond, turning away his eyes that he might not meet\\r\\n\\n\\nthe agonizing appeal in hers. “It is so.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You _ought_ to be, but you are _not_ the wife of Alexander Lyon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not his wife—not Alick’s wife! Oh, Alick, Alick! my own! my dear! my\\r\\n\\n\\nlove! my husband! I _am_ your wife! I am—I am!” cried the wronged and\\r\\n\\n\\nwretched young creature, with a sob and a gasp, as she sank back among\\r\\n\\n\\nher cushions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick could have wept for company, but he only cursed Alick and pitied\\r\\n\\n\\nher, while he watched and waited for her to recover herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh! how many tears she had shed in her short married life of less than a\\r\\n\\n\\nyear!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently her anguish broke forth in a sharp and bitter cry:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, oh why, do you say such terrible things to me, Mr. Hammond?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because it is absolutely necessary that you should know them,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered, kindly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Have you no pity—_none_—that you drive this sorrow-like a sword into my\\r\\n\\n\\nheart?” she cried.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Heaven knows how much pity and how much respect I have for you,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what—oh what,” she sobbed, wringing her hands in her agony, “oh,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat makes you say that I am not his wife—not my dear Alick’s wife? When\\r\\n\\n\\nI told you—_I told you_ how I was married; with a special license, by a\\r\\n\\n\\nregularly ordained minister, and in the presence of a dozen witnesses?\\r\\n\\n\\nHow _can_ you say, in the face of all this, that I am not Alick’s wife?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear Drusilla, on my honor as a gentleman, by my knowledge as a\\r\\n\\n\\nlawyer, and on my faith as a Christian, I assure you, that though your\\r\\n\\n\\nnuptial ceremony had been pronounced by a bishop, and in the presence of\\r\\n\\n\\na thousand witnesses, the very existence of this little document as it\\r\\n\\n\\nlies before us proves that ceremony to have been illegal and of no\\r\\n\\n\\neffect.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe clasped her hands and gazed on him with such a look of unutterable\\r\\n\\n\\nwoe in her voice, that he could no more bear to meet her eyes than could\\r\\n\\n\\nthe heroes of old endure Medusa’s glance and live. Yet withal she was\\r\\n\\n\\nnow very calm, though with a calmness that was but a restrained frenzy;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut it must have deceived Dick as to her powers of endurance, or he\\r\\n\\n\\nwould not have driven the spear home to her heart as in a few moments he\\r\\n\\n\\ndid.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And Alick knew this?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am not sure he knew it or thought of it on the wedding-day. But I am\\r\\n\\n\\nsure that he knows it now,” sighed Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And so his fancy was a fact after all; and he was no monomaniac?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, he was no monomaniac,” said Dick. “He was only a scoundrel,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nadded, under his breath.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Alick knows this! Then this is the discovery he made in March?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Probably, if he made any.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He told me he had discovered then our marriage was not legal. He has\\r\\n\\n\\nabsented himself from me ever since. Heaven help me! I thought he was\\r\\n\\n\\nsuffering from a hallucination that would pass away. And it was a\\r\\n\\n\\nreality!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it was,” said Dick, wondering at her apparent composure and misled\\r\\n\\n\\nby it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But Alick will remedy the evil now. He will marry me over again. You\\r\\n\\n\\nknow he will, Mr. Hammond?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know he ought to do so; I know he is bound by the holiest obligations\\r\\n\\n\\nthat can bind a man to do so; I know if he had one spark of honor in him\\r\\n\\n\\nhe _would_ do so; but I do not believe he will,” growled Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How dare you say that?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because if he had the slightest intention of doing you justice, he\\r\\n\\n\\nwould never even dream of the step he is now actually about to take, and\\r\\n\\n\\nof which I came here on purpose to warn you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What step? You said something of this when you first arrived. What is\\r\\n\\n\\nit?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A step which, (were you his wife, as you ought in justice to be) would\\r\\n\\n\\ntake him across the threshold of a state’s prison, for it would be a\\r\\n\\n\\nfelony,” answered Hammond, speaking distinctly and emphatically, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhoping that she would understand him, and save him the pain of a more\\r\\n\\n\\nparticular explanation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she did not even suspect his meaning. She only clasped her hands,\\r\\n\\n\\nand gazed at him with piteous and beseeching eyes, and murmured:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is it? Speak plainly.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe turned away his head that he might not witness her despair, as he\\r\\n\\n\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He is about to take advantage of the discovery he has made by marrying\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Anna Ly——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHis words were cut short by a piercing shriek that rang like the cry of\\r\\n\\n\\na lost soul through the air. He started up and confronted Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was standing before him, in motionless, speechless anguish. Her face\\r\\n\\n\\nwas blanched to the hue of death, her eyes were dilated and strained,\\r\\n\\n\\nher hands were extended, her form rigid. As one struck with catalepsy,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a moment she stood thus, and then fell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHammond caught her before she struck the floor, and laid her tenderly on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe sofa, and then in great alarm, he rang for assistance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer servants were at that hour gathered around the kitchen table eating\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir dinner, and talking of the strange visitor whom they had all seen\\r\\n\\n\\nenter the house in company with their mistress. They heard the shriek\\r\\n\\n\\nthat rang through the air, followed by the loud peals of the\\r\\n\\n\\nparlor-bell, and they started up in a body and ran to see what the\\r\\n\\n\\nmatter could be.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey found their mistress in a swoon on the sofa, and a strange\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman standing over her, beside himself with fear and grief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“For Heaven’s sake do something. I fear Mrs. Lyon is dying or dead!” he\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What caused it, sir?” demanded “mammy,” putting aside the intruder, and\\r\\n\\n\\nkneeling down to examine her patient.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I was so unhappy as to be the bearer of bad news to her,” Dick\\r\\n\\n\\nconfessed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, sir, you ought to a-knowed better than for to a-told it to her in\\r\\n\\n\\nher state of health. It may a-killed her,” said the nurse severely, as\\r\\n\\n\\nis the custom of her class in rebuking the common enemy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick looked guilty and wretched.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPina pitied him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, mammy, it aint killed her—she aint dead; ’deed she aint, mammy.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe’s only in one of her fainty fits. She’s subject to ’em, mammy,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nthe girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You hold your tongue, gal. What do you know? Come here and help me to\\r\\n\\n\\nrub her hands. And Mr. Leo, you go ’bout your business. What call you go\\r\\n\\n\\nto be poking ’round where there’s a lady sick? And _you_, sir,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nmammy, turning to the unhappy Dick, “now you’s done all the harm you can\\r\\n\\n\\ndo, you go ’way too.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick turned a long, lingering look to the inanimate form on the sofa,\\r\\n\\n\\nand then reluctantly followed his companion in banishment from the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen they reached the hall, Leo politely opened the front door for the\\r\\n\\n\\nexit of the visitor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Dick loitered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come here, boy,” he said, beckoning Leo close to his side. “Is your\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress realty subject to these swooning fits?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes sir; and so has been ever since master took to his ways,” answered\\r\\n\\n\\nthe boy, sulkily, because for the time being he hated all mankind, and,\\r\\n\\n\\nmost of all, his master, for his mistress’s sake.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What ways?” asked Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gentlemen’s ways, sir,” growled Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—she gets over these attacks?” asked Dick, anxiously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe boy looked at the questioner askance, and answered, ironically:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Sir; slight as they is, she allus dies of ’em.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick smiled, even in the midst of his trouble, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, I pardon your impertinence for the sake of the regard that I see\\r\\n\\n\\nyou bear your mistress. Don’t mock me again, but answer me truly—these\\r\\n\\n\\nswoons are not dangerous, are they?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, I don’t think they is. The women allus gets her out of ’em\\r\\n\\n\\nin an hour or so,” said Leo, somewhat mollified by the sincere interest\\r\\n\\n\\nthis stranger took in his mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, my boy, when your mistress is quite well, say to-morrow morning,\\r\\n\\n\\nif she is well enough to be up, I wish you to give her this packet,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Dick offering Leo a large, long, well-filled yellow envelope.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo backed several paces, and put his hands behind him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What’s that for?” inquired the visitor. “Why don’t you take this?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is it a writ?” asked the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick laughed now.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, stupid! I have been more used to having writs served upon _me_,\\r\\n\\n\\nthan to serving them upon _others_. Do I look like a bum baillie?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, take this and give it to your mistress when she gets\\r\\n\\n\\nbetter.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the boy backed farther, and kept his hands behind him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Are you crazy?” asked Dick, impatiently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, sir; but I want to know what is in that there yaller hang-wallop,\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore I tetches of it to take it to my mist’ess, ’cause she’s been put\\r\\n\\n\\nupon bad enough a’ready, the dear knows,” said Leo, stubbornly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Hammond good-humoredly opened the yellow envelope, and for the boy’s\\r\\n\\n\\nsatisfaction displayed its contents, which consisted of two open\\r\\n\\n\\nletters, one sealed letter and a newspaper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There,” he said, as he replaced them, “you see there is nothing very\\r\\n\\n\\ndangerous in the packet. It is for your mistress’s benefit that I wish\\r\\n\\n\\nto send it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, I’ll take it to her; and I hope, sir, you’ll ’scuse me for\\r\\n\\n\\nhanging back and doubting,” said Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Certainly; I respect your scruples, and I like you all the better for\\r\\n\\n\\nyour fidelity to your mistress. And now, listen. I want you to do\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething else for me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You know the ‘Drovers’ Rest?’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is it that little shady inn on the road, just before you turn into our\\r\\n\\n\\nwoods, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The very same; it is the only inn within half a mile. I shall wait\\r\\n\\n\\nthere until evening to hear how your mistress is. Do you think you can\\r\\n\\n\\nslip across there to bring me news of her this afternoon?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’ll try, sir—yes, sir, I’ll come, sir,” said the boy, first\\r\\n\\n\\nhesitating, and then consenting.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. Don’t forget to do so,” said Mr. Hammond, dropping a small\\r\\n\\n\\ngold coin into Leo’s hand, and then hurrying from the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XLI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                                PROOFS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n               Concealment is no more; facts speak\\r\\n\\n\\n               All circumstance that may compel\\r\\n\\n\\n               Full credence to the tale they tell,\\r\\n\\n\\n               And now her tortured heart and ear,\\r\\n\\n\\n               Hath nothing more to feel, or hear.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was long, very long, before the most strenuous and persevering\\r\\n\\n\\nefforts of her servants could bring the stricken and unconscious\\r\\n\\n\\nsufferer back to consciousness. As always before, the return to\\r\\n\\n\\nsensibility was but the return to sorrow. But the nurse prepared a dose\\r\\n\\n\\nof morphine, and, murmuring to her of her babe, persuaded her to take\\r\\n\\n\\nit. And soon she was buried in the blessed oblivion of sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo sat over the kitchen fire, wishing himself a man and a white man,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he might avenge the wrongs of his worshipped mistress. In his small\\r\\n\\n\\nway, very much as the child Willie Douglas felt towards the beautiful\\r\\n\\n\\nand discrowned Mary Stuart, felt this poor fellow towards the wronged\\r\\n\\n\\nlady of his own allegiance. Late in the evening, to him, sitting there,\\r\\n\\n\\ncame Pina.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, and how is she now?” inquired the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Gone to bed. Mammy give her something to put her to sleep. Mammy knows\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat to do. My goodness, Leo, what a blessing it is that we fetched\\r\\n\\n\\nmammy to her!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, that it was, Pina.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now you clear out here. I want to get some supper ready for mammy\\r\\n\\n\\nto eat. She hasn’t had no dinner, nor even a mortal bite since\\r\\n\\n\\nbreakfast. My gracious, what a tiresome thing it is to have a house\\r\\n\\n\\nalways up side down like ours. Just as if there was a somebody a being\\r\\n\\n\\nburied or a being borned every day in the week! and all on account of\\r\\n\\n\\nthat man! Yes, I _will_ call him ‘that man,’ if I’m hashed for it!—that\\r\\n\\n\\nman! that man! that man! there, now! And I don’t see no use no men ever\\r\\n\\n\\nis, ’cept ’tis to make a fuss in the family! And I know as the Lord made\\r\\n\\n\\nthe wimmin; but I b’lieve in my heart and soul the debil made all the\\r\\n\\n\\nmen, jest to spile the Lord’s work! And I wish there wasn’t a man in the\\r\\n\\n\\nworld, ’cept ’tis _you_, Leo, and Cousin Charley, and daddy! So there,\\r\\n\\n\\nnow! And now why don’t you go ’bout your business and leave me room to\\r\\n\\n\\nmove ’round the range and get supper?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo, with a certain sense of shame in belonging to that offending and\\r\\n\\n\\nprescribed sex created by the devil for the confusion of the world,\\r\\n\\n\\ngladly took himself out of the kitchen and went to keep his appointment\\r\\n\\n\\nwith his fellow sinner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe found Mr. Richard Hammond in the little back parlor of the suburban\\r\\n\\n\\ninn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick was seated at a table; with writing materials, and also, alas! with\\r\\n\\n\\nbrandy, tobacco and pipes before him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Your mistress? I hope she is better?” exclaimed Dick, eagerly, on\\r\\n\\n\\nseeing his messenger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir; the wimmin, they have fetched her out’n her fainty fit all\\r\\n\\n\\nright, and they have put her to sleep comfortable,” replied the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, that is all I have to tell you; and now, as I may be missed,\\r\\n\\n\\nI think I had better hurry back,” said Leo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wait; here is a letter I wish you to take to your mistress.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Another one, sir?” inquired the boy, distrustfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; but _this_ letter is to prepare her for the receipt of the packet.\\r\\n\\n\\nI wish you to give her _this_ letter _first_. And after she has read it,\\r\\n\\n\\nhand her the packet.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And here is your reward,” said Mr. Hammond, putting a piece of gold in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe boy’s hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir, I don’t like to take any pay for serving of her,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Leo, hesitatingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense! Take it for serving me, then,” laughed Dick, forcing the\\r\\n\\n\\nmoney upon the youth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo pocketed the fee, and hurried home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was quite dark when he reached the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAll that night mammy sat up and watched by the bedside of her charge.\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla slept soundly and late.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAll dreaded her awakening. But to the surprise and relief of her\\r\\n\\n\\nattendants, she awoke quite calmly; though whether her quietude was the\\r\\n\\n\\nlethargy produced by the continued influence of the morphine, or whether\\r\\n\\n\\nit was the apathy of despair, it was hard to tell. She permitted the\\r\\n\\n\\nnurse to bathe her face and hands, and to smoothe her hair. She partook\\r\\n\\n\\nslightly of the light breakfast that was brought her. But beyond these\\r\\n\\n\\nshe scarcely moved, looked or spoke. After an hour or two she intimated\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she would rise; and, with the assistance of her nurse, she got up,\\r\\n\\n\\ndressed herself, and went to her easy chair. And there she sat, pale,\\r\\n\\n\\nmute, and still as death.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mammy,” whispered Pina, “speak to her—make her talk. Indeed it scares\\r\\n\\n\\nme all but to death to see her that away.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush,” muttered the nurse, “let her alone. ‘It’s ill waking sleeping\\r\\n\\n\\ndogs’—which I mean to say, long as she’s quiet be thankful for it, and\\r\\n\\n\\ndon’t ’sturb her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I’d rather see her cry, and scream, and rave, than see her so.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That’s because you’s a fool; for I hadn’t, and that’s a fact, in her\\r\\n\\n\\nsitivation, too! Go ’long gal; what you know?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Leo watched for an opportunity to execute the commission\\r\\n\\n\\nentrusted to him. He did not find one until the afternoon, when mammy\\r\\n\\n\\nand Pina being seated at their early dinner, sent Leo with an armful of\\r\\n\\n\\nwood up to the lady’s chamber to replenish the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the boy had done that duty, swept up the hearth, and replaced the\\r\\n\\n\\nshovel and tongs, he turned to where his mistress sat, in her chair,\\r\\n\\n\\npale, silent, and motionless as a statue, and he drew the letter from\\r\\n\\n\\nhis pocket, and offered her, saying, respectfully:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“From the gentleman who was here yesterday, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla mechanically took the letter, and stared blankly at the boy for\\r\\n\\n\\na moment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where did you get this?” she inquired, as she broke the seal; and her\\r\\n\\n\\nvoice sounded strangely to her attendant as she asked the question.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“From the gentleman who was here yesterday, ma’am, as I said,” repeated\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is he here to-day?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“When then did you get this?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yesterday, ma’am, before he left the neighborhood,” answered the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla read the letter. It was directed very formally to Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander Lyon, Cedarwood Cottage. It ran thus:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                                         DROVERS’ REST, Tuesday Evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n  MY DEAREST LADY.—As the executioner, kneeling, begs pardon of the\\r\\n\\n\\n  victim he is about to slay, so humbly at your feet I would implore\\r\\n\\n\\n  forgiveness for the blow I am fated to strike you, as well as for all\\r\\n\\n\\n  the pain I have already been forced to give you. But after having\\r\\n\\n\\n  stated some strange facts to you, I feel bound to prove the truth of\\r\\n\\n\\n  my statement. The bearer of this will also deliver to you certain\\r\\n\\n\\n  papers, to which I beg leave to call your particular attention. Your\\r\\n\\n\\n  own pure spirit will teach you how to act in the premises. And now, my\\r\\n\\n\\n  dear Mrs. Lyon, I can not close this letter without entreating you to\\r\\n\\n\\n  remember, and to take comfort in the remembrance, that in this great\\r\\n\\n\\n  trial of yours you are only the sufferer, not the sinner; that in the\\r\\n\\n\\n  judgment of all good and honorable people you will be held blameless.\\r\\n\\n\\n  And as for myself, here in all honesty of purpose, as in the sight of\\r\\n\\n\\n  Heaven, I offer you my utmost services. All that a brother might do\\r\\n\\n\\n  for a beloved sister, or a father for an idolized daughter in her\\r\\n\\n\\n  distress, I will do for you. I and all I possess shall be at your\\r\\n\\n\\n  commands; and my business and my pleasure shall at any time give way\\r\\n\\n\\n  to your requirements of me. A letter directed to me at the general\\r\\n\\n\\n  post-office, Washington, will always find me, where-ever I may be, and\\r\\n\\n\\n  always as Your respectful friend,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                                                        RICHARD HAMMOND.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla read this letter, and with a sigh, but without a syllable, she\\r\\n\\n\\nlaid it aside, and held out her hand to Leo, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Give me the other papers.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe boy drew from his pocket the large, yellow envelope, and delivered\\r\\n\\n\\nit to her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe opened it and emptied out its contents. The first that caught her\\r\\n\\n\\neye was a newspaper with a marked passage in it. She took it up. It was\\r\\n\\n\\nthe _Valley Courier_, a little local journal published in the county\\r\\n\\n\\ntown near the county-seat of General Lyon. And the marked passage was as\\r\\n\\n\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n  MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE.—We understand that Alexander Lyon, Esq., of\\r\\n\\n\\n  Crow Wood, only son and heir of the late eminent Chief Justice of that\\r\\n\\n\\n  name, is about to lead to the hymeneal altar his cousin, the beautiful\\r\\n\\n\\n  and accomplished Anna, the grand-daughter and sole heiress of the\\r\\n\\n\\n  veteran General Lyon, of old Lyon Hall and of Revolutionary celebrity.\\r\\n\\n\\n  The engagement has been of long standing, the nuptials having been\\r\\n\\n\\n  twice arrested by the hand of death. Now however, we are happy to\\r\\n\\n\\n  learn that, both at Crow Wood, the seat of the bridegroom, and at Old\\r\\n\\n\\n  Lyon Hall, the home of the bride, the most splendid preparations are\\r\\n\\n\\n  on foot in honor of the joyful occasion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla read this article and, without a word of comment, a movement of\\r\\n\\n\\nfeature, or a change of color, she put it down and took up a letter with\\r\\n\\n\\na broken seal. She unfolded and read it. It was from General Lyon to\\r\\n\\n\\nRichard Hammond.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                                             OLD LYON HALL, Nov. 1, 18—.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n  MY DEAR DICK:—Alick and Anna are to be married on Thursday, the\\r\\n\\n\\n  fifteenth instant. And now, my dear boy, I wish you, with your\\r\\n\\n\\n  accustomed frankness and good humor, to “let by-gones be by-gones,”\\r\\n\\n\\n  and to come down and be present at the wedding. I know it will be\\r\\n\\n\\n  painful to you; but brave men do not shrink from pain. And, Dick, you\\r\\n\\n\\n  know that there are but four of us left out of all the old stock—Dick,\\r\\n\\n\\n  Alick, Anna and me. I have long passed the threescore and ten years\\r\\n\\n\\n  allotted as the natural term of a man’s life, and so may daily look\\r\\n\\n\\n  for my summons hence. Dick, Alick and Anna seem to me as my own\\r\\n\\n\\n  children. Dick, you have never in your life pleased me with one single\\r\\n\\n\\n  sight of your face at Old Lyon Hall. I know why you have kept away, my\\r\\n\\n\\n  boy. But now I trust you will conquer your reluctance and come, rather\\r\\n\\n\\n  than grieve the soul of Your loving uncle,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                                                           LEONARD LYON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStill without a syllable of complaint, or a variation of complexion, she\\r\\n\\n\\nlet this letter flutter down from her hand, and she raised the sole\\r\\n\\n\\nremaining one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was a sealed envelope, directed to herself. She broke the seal and\\r\\n\\n\\nfound an old and closely written communication from General Lyon to\\r\\n\\n\\nRichard Hammond, which it is unnecessary to give here at length. It was\\r\\n\\n\\nvery necessary, however, for Drusilla’s knowledge of the whole truth\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she should read every line of it. So at least thought Dick, and\\r\\n\\n\\ntherefore he had sent it to her with the others, but _sealed_, lest\\r\\n\\n\\nother eyes should see its meaning. In this letter General Lyon spoke of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe long season in Washington during which himself, Alick, Anna and Dick\\r\\n\\n\\nwere always together. And thus Drusilla, for the first time, learned the\\r\\n\\n\\ntrue nature of that “business connected with his late father’s will”\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich had taken Alexander daily and nightly from her side. And now she\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovered the double-dealing and the deep dishonor of the man she\\r\\n\\n\\ncalled her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe dropped this last letter, and it fell at her feet. Her face turned\\r\\n\\n\\nno paler, because in fact it was already as pale as it could possibly\\r\\n\\n\\nbe, and had not a vestige of color to lose.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe had already suffered so much, so much that it seemed impossible for\\r\\n\\n\\nher to suffer more. Blow after blow had fallen with cruel weight upon\\r\\n\\n\\nher young heart, until it seemed benumbed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBesides, what had she learned now worse than that which she had known\\r\\n\\n\\nand wept for many days—his treachery to her? Only through the numbness\\r\\n\\n\\nof her heart and the dullness of her head, one feeling and one thought\\r\\n\\n\\nclearly and strongly moved—that his marriage with Miss Lyon must be\\r\\n\\n\\narrested and he himself saved from this last culmination of his criminal\\r\\n\\n\\ncareer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe extremity of sorrow, when it does not destroy life or reason, always\\r\\n\\n\\nstrengthens the character. Such must have been its effect upon Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nto enable her to rise above her misery and her weakness, with the fixed\\r\\n\\n\\ndetermination to go in person to Old Lyon Hall, for the purpose of\\r\\n\\n\\npreventing that “MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE” which the _Valley Courier_ had\\r\\n\\n\\nannounced to the world with such a grand flourish of editorial trumpets.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XLII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                        DRUSILLA’S DESTINATION.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n              One human hand my own to take,\\r\\n\\n\\n                One human heart my own to raise,\\r\\n\\n\\n              One loving human voice to break\\r\\n\\n\\n                The silence of my days.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n              Saviour, if this wild prayer be wrong\\r\\n\\n\\n                And what I seek I may not find,\\r\\n\\n\\n              Oh, make more hard, and stern, and strong\\r\\n\\n\\n                The frame-work of my mind!—OWEN MEREDITH.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHaving finished reading all the letters and papers that had been\\r\\n\\n\\nsubmitted to her examination, in proof of the perfidy of her husband,\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla sat on, for a few moments, pale, still, and mute. She would not\\r\\n\\n\\nweep now—the fountain of her tears was dry at last. She could scarcely\\r\\n\\n\\nfeel—her heart was stunned almost to insensibility.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNow she knew the very worst. Now she could not doubt that her husband\\r\\n\\n\\nhad deserted her and that he meditated the crime of marriage with his\\r\\n\\n\\ncousin Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYes, the crime!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor, notwithstanding all that Richard Hammond had said and thought to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe contrary, she knew that she herself not only ought to have been, in\\r\\n\\n\\nright—but really was, in fact—the true wife of Alexander Lyon; and that\\r\\n\\n\\nit was but a slight legal informality, unsuspected by her and even by\\r\\n\\n\\nhim at the time of their marriage, of which he was now about to avail\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself in breaking the sacred bonds that bound him to his young wife,\\r\\n\\n\\nin order to unite himself to his wealthy cousin. She knew that this\\r\\n\\n\\nintended act would be a sin, and she feared that it might be construed\\r\\n\\n\\ninto a felony. There was an ugly word in the dictionary called “bigamy,”\\r\\n\\n\\nand its penalty was uglier still—the state’s prison. To save Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nin his moral insanity, from such guilt and such degradation, she\\r\\n\\n\\nresolved to go to Old Lyon Hall and stop the intended marriage, even\\r\\n\\n\\nthough the adventure should cost her her life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And the wedding is to be celebrated on the evening of the fifteenth,\\r\\n\\n\\nand this is the morning of the fourteenth, and I have but little more\\r\\n\\n\\nthan twenty-four hours to do all that must be done to save him!” she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, speaking her mind aloud, to the infinite surprise and alarm of\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo, who was still standing before her and who now looked as if he\\r\\n\\n\\nthought his mistress had gone crazy,—and “well she might,” he said to\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself, as he gazed on her where she sat with her hands clasped to her\\r\\n\\n\\ntemples.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla reflected intently for a few moments. There were several ways\\r\\n\\n\\nof reaching Old Lyon Hall,—one was to go by steamer down the Potomac to\\r\\n\\n\\nChesapeake Bay and up James River to the Stormy Petrel landing, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nby turnpike to the Porcupine Mountain; another was to take the railway\\r\\n\\n\\ntrain from Alexandria to Richmond, and then the stage-coach across the\\r\\n\\n\\ncountry. Both these routes were favored by the Lyon family when they had\\r\\n\\n\\nleisure and were travelling for recreation. But both required two days\\r\\n\\n\\nof travel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla saw that she must take the third, which was the shortest if the\\r\\n\\n\\nroughest route—the old line of stagecoaches running between Washington\\r\\n\\n\\ncity and Western Virginia. It is true this road was very dangerous,\\r\\n\\n\\nespecially at night. It crossed the Blue Ridge, the Shenandoah, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nAlleghany mountains. It wound around terrible heights where there were\\r\\n\\n\\nmany hundred feet of perpendicular rock above and below, with little\\r\\n\\n\\nwidth of way between. Once in a while you heard of a coach being crushed\\r\\n\\n\\nby the fall of the rocks from above, or dashed to pieces by going over\\r\\n\\n\\nthe side of the precipice. Upon the whole this was not a favored route\\r\\n\\n\\nwith travellers who could avoid it. But Drusilla resolved to take it\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause it was the shortest to her place of destination, and in less\\r\\n\\n\\nthan twenty-four hours it would take her to a little mountain hamlet\\r\\n\\n\\nwithin ten miles of Old Lyon Hall. True, she might meet with an accident\\r\\n\\n\\non the road, but if she should lose her life she might serve Alick by\\r\\n\\n\\nthat means as well or better than by preventing his marriage with Anna,\\r\\n\\n\\nsince if she (Drusilla) were dead, that marriage would be no longer\\r\\n\\n\\ncriminal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo,” she inquired, looking up at the anxious boy, “what is the hour?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo glanced at the ormolu clock on the mantle-piece, and answered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is nearly one, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do you know what time the night coach for Western Virginia leaves\\r\\n\\n\\nWashington?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know what time it leaves Washington, ma’am, but it passes\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough Alexandry at five.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then it must start at about three or half-past. Leo! hurry down stairs;\\r\\n\\n\\ntell your mother and Pina to come to me immediately. Then go to the\\r\\n\\n\\nstable and put the horses to the carriage, and prepare yourself to drive\\r\\n\\n\\nme to town, and be as quick as you possibly can; do you hear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am,” answered the amazed boy, making his awkward bow, and going\\r\\n\\n\\non his errand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, with a marvellous new life in her system, arose and went to\\r\\n\\n\\nher bureau drawers and began hastily to select certain indispensable\\r\\n\\n\\nconveniences for her journey, and to pack them into a travelling bag.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh! at that moment, and under those circumstances what painful feelings\\r\\n\\n\\nthat pretty Turkey morocco bag awakened; for “sorrow’s crown of sorrow\\r\\n\\n\\nis the memory of happier days.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe bag had been given to her first, by old Mrs. Lyon, when that lady\\r\\n\\n\\nhad hoped to take her favorite down to old Lyon Hall to the wedding of\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick and Anna. And well Drusilla remembered how much she was pleased\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the gift that combined beauty with utility; how much she admired\\r\\n\\n\\nits construction, with its various pockets and recesses for the\\r\\n\\n\\nreception of all sorts of travelling necessaries. But she never went\\r\\n\\n\\ndown to that wedding, which never took place, as you already know.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNext, nearly two years afterward, she had packed this very bag for her\\r\\n\\n\\njourney to meet Alick and to be married to him, herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd now she was packing it to go and prevent his marriage with his\\r\\n\\n\\ncousin. Truly, the little bag was associated with weddings for good or\\r\\n\\n\\nill.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile Drusilla was stowing away combs, brushes, soap, cologne, napkins,\\r\\n\\n\\nhandkerchiefs, chamber-slippers, etc., into her travelling bag, and\\r\\n\\n\\nreflecting on all its happy and unhappy associations, she was\\r\\n\\n\\ninterrupted by the hasty entrance of Pina and Pina’s mammy, both with\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir eyes wide open in astonishment; for Leo had startled them both\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the announcement that his mistress had ordered the carriage quite\\r\\n\\n\\nsuddenly to go the city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, ma’am, what is all this, to be sure?” inquired “mammy,” with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe authority, not to say the insolence, belonging even to the best of\\r\\n\\n\\nher sisterhood.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is what, nurse?” questioned Drusilla, with calm dignity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That boy—which I believe he’s lying, and if he is I will chastise him\\r\\n\\n\\nwell for it—says how you has ordered the carriage to go to Washington\\r\\n\\n\\nimmediate; which I know, ma’am, you would never think of doing nothing\\r\\n\\n\\nso unprudent; and I’ll give it to Leo well for scaring of me with his\\r\\n\\n\\nlies.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo has told you no falsehood. I have ordered the carriage to take me\\r\\n\\n\\nto the city,” said Drusilla, calmly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, ma’am, I hope you’ll follow my ’vice and think better of it, and\\r\\n\\n\\ndo no such undiscreet thing,” said mammy, grimly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have no choice, nurse. This is not with me a matter of will, but of\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessity. I must go to Washington to take the night coach for Western\\r\\n\\n\\nVirginia.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt this announcement, mammy stared for a moment in speechless\\r\\n\\n\\nconsternation. Then lifting both her hands, she exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To take the night coach for Wes’ Wirginy! Well, Lord! And is you\\r\\n\\n\\ncrazy?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, not crazy; though I know how strange my purpose must seem to you,”\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered Drusilla, quietly, as she folded some white linen collars, and\\r\\n\\n\\nplaced them in her bag.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And DOES you know the dangers?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Of the road? Well, I recollect that there was a coach upset on the\\r\\n\\n\\nHogback Mountain, and nine passengers killed or wounded, only last\\r\\n\\n\\nspring.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t mean the road, though that’s as bad as bad can be, to my\\r\\n\\n\\nsartain knowledge, which has travelled of it once. I mean your\\r\\n\\n\\nsiteration, there! do you know the dangers of _that_, a bumping and a\\r\\n\\n\\nthumping, and a tumbling and a rumbling over them rocky roads? I say, do\\r\\n\\n\\nyou know the dangers of _that_?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, I don’t, nurse; I only know that whatever they are, I must face\\r\\n\\n\\nthem,” said Drusilla, so calmly and so firmly, that the old woman knew\\r\\n\\n\\nat once that it would be utterly vain to try to turn her from her\\r\\n\\n\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, for goodness sake, _why_ must you go?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“From imminent necessity, nurse, that I can’t stop now to explain. I\\r\\n\\n\\nwish you to be kind enough to pack up under clothing and other\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessaries enough to last me a week. Pina, empty the little red trunk\\r\\n\\n\\nand bring it here to nurse.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, for patience’s sake, whar is you going, child?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am going to see my husband.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are going to your death!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps. If so, I shall serve him just as well,” murmured Drusilla, in\\r\\n\\n\\na low tone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, child, tell me, what’s the great ’cessity? What for must you go to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee your husband sich a long distance over sich roads in your\\r\\n\\n\\nsiteration, and to the rist of your life?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He is—in imminent danger,” said Drusilla, evasively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor! and that was the bad news as that gentleman brought you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it was.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And it overcomed you so! Well, Lord! to think of the tender heart! But\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat is the matter of him, honey?—pleurisy, I shouldn’t wonder! That’s\\r\\n\\n\\nmost in general what ails people this time of the year. Is it pleurisy,\\r\\n\\n\\nhoney?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, not that; but do not stop now to ask questions. I have no time to\\r\\n\\n\\nanswer them. Here is Pina with the trunk. And here are my keys. Go to my\\r\\n\\n\\nwardrobes and bureaus, and select what is needful for my journey. And\\r\\n\\n\\npray be quick about it, for I have no time to lose.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, but honey, hear me for one minute first. It may be that he is\\r\\n\\n\\nvery ill, but he may get over it, ’out your gwine to see him. Yes, and\\r\\n\\n\\nif you go, he may get well and you may die. And anyway, I don’t see the\\r\\n\\n\\nuse of two lives and maybe three lives risted instead of one. Take my\\r\\n\\n\\n’vice, honey, and stay quietly at home.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nurse, listen. I should suffer a thousand times more in _mind_ to stay\\r\\n\\n\\nhere, than I possibly could to go the journey that I have fully resolved\\r\\n\\n\\nto take,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, honey, in either case your life must be risted, I suppose; and of\\r\\n\\n\\ncourse you have got a right to take your choice _how_ it shall be\\r\\n\\n\\nristed. So now, all I got to do is to make your journey as comfor’ble as\\r\\n\\n\\nI can.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. That is indeed all that you can do,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But mind, honey, _I gwine long with you_,” said mammy, with grim\\r\\n\\n\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You? You going, nurse? I have not asked you!” exclaimed Drusilla, in\\r\\n\\n\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, honey, you haven’t axed me; which I believe you never even thought\\r\\n\\n\\nof so doing. But if you must travel—by night, too—surely you’d never\\r\\n\\n\\nthink of travelling alone in your state of health.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is true—I never thought of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Which it seems to me you never do think of yourself, honey.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But it is a hard journey for you to undertake. Would not Pina do as\\r\\n\\n\\nwell to go with me?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hi, honey, what good Pina going to be, case you taken ill on the road?\\r\\n\\n\\nNo, child, long as you _will_ go, you must consent to take the ole ’oman\\r\\n\\n\\nalong to look after you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I believe you are right; quite right; and I thank you very much. But\\r\\n\\n\\nnow you must let Pina pack that little trunk for me, while you go and\\r\\n\\n\\nget ready to attend me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And be very quick, nurse. See, it is half-past one. It will take us an\\r\\n\\n\\nhour to ride to Washington, and I wish to be there by three o’clock, so\\r\\n\\n\\nas to make sure of the coach.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right, ma’am. I will be ready in half an hour.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the old woman hurried away, not ill pleased to vary the monotony of\\r\\n\\n\\nher life at Cedarwood by a journey, this fine weather, into the\\r\\n\\n\\nmountainous regions of Virginia. It is true that this was a measure she\\r\\n\\n\\nwould not have recommended to her patient; but, since that lady was\\r\\n\\n\\nresolved upon it, “mammy” made the best of it, and determined to draw\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat good she might out of the change of scene and circumstances.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn just ten minutes mammy returned to the room, dressed for her journey,\\r\\n\\n\\nand equipped with a carpet bag that contained all her travelling\\r\\n\\n\\nbelongings.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have been very quick,” said Drusilla, approvingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, honey; which it is my pride and ambition always so to be. I had\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf an hour; that’s thirty minutes—three times ten. The first ten\\r\\n\\n\\nminutes I gives to getting myself ready. Now, the next ten minutes I\\r\\n\\n\\ngives to something else,” said mammy, speaking hastily, and, _while_\\r\\n\\n\\nspeaking, drawing from a closet a small red morocco trunk, which she\\r\\n\\n\\nproceeded to pack with a full supply of body linen and all the\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessaries of a baby’s first toilet, setting the baby’s basket in the\\r\\n\\n\\ntray in the top of the trunk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is all that for?” inquired Drusilla, who was busy hooking up her\\r\\n\\n\\ntravelling dress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Never you mind, honey. You go on a fixing of yourself, and leave me\\r\\n\\n\\nalone. And there, the second ten minutes is up!” said the old woman, as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe fastened down and locked the trunk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But what is that for?” persisted Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor’, honey, does you forget? There’s three of us going this journey.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd that trunk is for the third one. And now I have got only the last\\r\\n\\n\\nten minutes left, and I must give that to something else still,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nmammy, as she flew down stairs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile Drusilla, while putting on her cloak, bonnet and gloves, gave\\r\\n\\n\\nPina many charges about the care of the house, the birds, the dogs, and\\r\\n\\n\\nall the pets of the establishment, which would be in her charge during\\r\\n\\n\\nthe absence of the mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Pina promised the utmost fidelity; but begged her lady to order Leo\\r\\n\\n\\nto sleep in the house, because she, Pina, would be afraid to sleep there\\r\\n\\n\\nalone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla had but just promised this, when “mammy” reappeared with a\\r\\n\\n\\nlarge and well-filled luncheon basket.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How thoughtful you are. And how thankful I ought to be that I have you\\r\\n\\n\\nto think for me and to take care of me at this crisis,” said Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith feeling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor, honey, what’s the use of my having lived fifty year in this world\\r\\n\\n\\nif I _aint_ thoughtful? And what call you to be thankful to me, for\\r\\n\\n\\ndoing of that which it is my bounden duty to do, seeing I’m paid for\\r\\n\\n\\nit?” replied mammy, laughing, for her spirits were rising with the\\r\\n\\n\\nexcitement of the journey before her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, nurse, there are some services that cannot be purchased or paid\\r\\n\\n\\nfor, and yours are of that sort.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not a bit, honey. And now the time is up and we’s all ready. And here’s\\r\\n\\n\\neverything you can possibly want. And Leo, he told me to tell you as the\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage was waiting.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank you; we will go then.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, honey.——And, now, Pina, you be good gal and take care of the house\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile your missus is gone,” said the nurse, turning to her daughter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, mammy. When will missus be home?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“When you sees her, you fool; and not a minute sooner. And mind you have\\r\\n\\n\\neverything ready for her when she comes; fire made in her room and all;\\r\\n\\n\\nmind that, or it will be the worse for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, mammy.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla gave a last glance around the room, so full of pleasing and\\r\\n\\n\\npainful memories—the room which she felt she might never see again; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthen, silently commending herself to Providence, she left it and led the\\r\\n\\n\\nway down stairs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe carriage stood ready; the luggage was piled on behind. Leo had the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor open and the steps down. Drusilla entered, followed by her nurse.\\r\\n\\n\\nBoth took a kind last leave of Pina, who thrust her head and hands in at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe window for the purpose. And Leo cracked his whip and started his\\r\\n\\n\\nhorses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XLIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                         THE DREARY NIGHT RIDE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n              Her brain is sick with thinking,\\r\\n\\n\\n              Her heart is almost sinking,\\r\\n\\n\\n              She cannot look before her,\\r\\n\\n\\n                On the evil haunted way;\\r\\n\\n\\n              Uphold her, oh! restore her!\\r\\n\\n\\n                Thou Lord of life and day.—MONCTON MILNES.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA few minutes after three o’clock, the carriage containing Drusilla and\\r\\n\\n\\nher attendant stopped before the office of the Washington and Western\\r\\n\\n\\nVirginia line of stage coaches.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn great anxiety, Drusilla drew up the carriage curtain and looked out\\r\\n\\n\\nof the window.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was no sign of a coach near the office.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is gone, it is gone,” she cried, clasping her hands in despair. “It\\r\\n\\n\\nis gone and I know I can never reach the place in time to save him!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now don’t you take on so, ma’am, that’s a dear child. The coach mayn’t\\r\\n\\n\\nhave come yet, much less gone,” said mammy, soothingly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile the porters about the office had come forward and commenced\\r\\n\\n\\nunstrapping the baggage from behind.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo jumped off his seat and came and opened the carriage door and let\\r\\n\\n\\ndown the steps.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is it any use to alight, Leo? Is not the coach gone?” sighed the lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor’, no, ma’am—it haven’t gone out of the stable yet. We’ve lots of\\r\\n\\n\\ntime.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, thank heaven!” exclaimed Drusilla, in a tone of great relief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy gathered up her carpet bag, umbrella and big shawl—all carried for\\r\\n\\n\\nher mistress’s accommodation and not for her own—and prepared to alight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Here, boy, you let me get out first, so I can help the madam,” she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, handing a part of her paraphernalia to her son, and then clumsily\\r\\n\\n\\nbut safely tumbling herself down to the sidewalk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Take care, mammy,” said the boy, when all the danger was over.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, that job’s done! I’m allus thankful when I can get out’n a\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage without hurting of myself or breaking anything. And now, honey,\\r\\n\\n\\nlet me help _you_ out. Be careful, child,” she said, holding her arms\\r\\n\\n\\nforth to receive her charge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Stand aside, please,” smiled Drusilla; and then, rather than avail\\r\\n\\n\\nherself of mammy’s dangerous assistance, she alighted without aid, and\\r\\n\\n\\nimmediately entered the office, calling Leo to attend her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSeeing a lady’s waiting-room back of the office, she gave her purse to\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo, telling him to go to the clerk and secure their seats; but then, as\\r\\n\\n\\nthe sudden thought that they might all be already taken flashed into her\\r\\n\\n\\nmind, she hurried after the boy up to the clerk’s desk and eagerly\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Have you any seats left in the coach now about to start?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Miss; lots. We have nine inside, and only one taken.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I will take two at once,” said Drusilla, with another sigh of\\r\\n\\n\\nrelieved anxiety.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Four, master, if you please; we’ll take four. _All_ the back seats and\\r\\n\\n\\none of the others,” said mammy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is that for?” hastily whispered Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“’Cause, child, you can’t sit up all night. You must lie down, and you\\r\\n\\n\\nmust have all the back seats to lie on like a sofy, you know,” whispered\\r\\n\\n\\nmammy, in reply.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How many seats will you take, Miss?” inquired the clerk, who had looked\\r\\n\\n\\non, pen in hand, while this low-toned consultation was going forward.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Four,” answered Drusilla. “And my servant here will settle for them.\\r\\n\\n\\nCome, nurse, leave Leo to finish this business, and attend me to the\\r\\n\\n\\nladies’ room.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, honey, in one minute. I just want to stop here and see the _back_\\r\\n\\n\\nseats secured all for you, all together, to lie down on. ’Twould be no\\r\\n\\n\\nuse for you to have three seats ’stributed all about the coach, for how\\r\\n\\n\\ncould you ’cline on them? Leave me to ’range for you, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very well, nurse, do as you think best,” said Drusilla, passing on to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe back room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was a side window, opening upon an alley leading to the stables\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere the coaches were kept.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla perceived this, and seated herself by the window to watch for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe coming of the night coach. She was in such a state of feverish\\r\\n\\n\\nanxiety, that she could not rest. True, two great causes of uneasiness\\r\\n\\n\\nwere removed. She was in time for the coach, and she could get seats\\r\\n\\n\\nenough; but still, in her eager impatience, she could not be at peace,\\r\\n\\n\\nand she longed to be on her journey, to feel herself whirled swiftly\\r\\n\\n\\nonward towards the place she was so ardently desirous to reach.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently she was joined by mammy, who dropped her fat self down upon a\\r\\n\\n\\nchair, making it creak under her weight, and said, triumphantly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, honey, it’s all right, and you’ll travel as easy as if you was a\\r\\n\\n\\nlying on your own sofy! I left that boy Leo to watch the luggidge.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’m very much obliged to you; but at the same time, if the coach should\\r\\n\\n\\nbe full, and any one should want two of my places, they must have them,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Must they? What’s the use o’ our paying for them, if it wasn’t to keep\\r\\n\\n\\nout all ’truders that _did_ come? If the coach wasn’t _going_ to be\\r\\n\\n\\nfull, we needn’t a paid for no extra seats, seeing as we might a had ’em\\r\\n\\n\\nfor nothing, ma’am. And don’t you think so much of other people. Think a\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle more of yourself, ma’am. Take a _little_ bit of pity on yourself,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich you never does, though the Lord knows you needs it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy’s discourse was interrupted by music as delightful to the eager\\r\\n\\n\\nears of Drusilla as the sublimest strains of Handel—the rumbling of the\\r\\n\\n\\nstage-coach as it rolled out of the stable yard, and whirled around the\\r\\n\\n\\ncorner and drew up before the office door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla was on her feet in an instant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now don’t be in such a hurry, ma’am. You be quiet. Bless you, it will\\r\\n\\n\\nbe some time yet before it starts. They’ve got all the luggidge to put\\r\\n\\n\\nup yet. Leo, he’ll call us when it’s time to get in.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith a sigh Drusilla dropped into her seat. Moments seemed hours, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhours months to her, until she could reach old Lyon Hall and prevent the\\r\\n\\n\\nconsummation of her Alick’s meditated crime.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt length the long wished for signal came. Leo looked into the room,\\r\\n\\n\\ntouched his hat, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Coach ready, ma’am.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla arose in haste and excitement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeo loaded himself with the light luggage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy drew her big blanket shawl about her, and so they went out of the\\r\\n\\n\\noffice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Leo, my good boy, take great care of yourself and your sister, and of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house and the animals, while I am gone,” said the lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am; you may trust me for that,” answered the boy, very\\r\\n\\n\\nearnestly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And Leo, mind, go to the office every day; and if you find letters for\\r\\n\\n\\nme, put them in the directed and stamped envelopes I gave you, and post\\r\\n\\n\\nthem with your own hand—do you hear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, and will be sure to remember,” said Leo, almost weeping.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe shook hands with her servant, and sent her love by him to Pina, and\\r\\n\\n\\nbade him good-bye.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn another moment Drusilla and her attendant were in the coach—the only\\r\\n\\n\\npassengers there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla sat reclining in the corner of the back seat, but mammy, who\\r\\n\\n\\nhad not yet seated herself, was fussing about, stowing away such\\r\\n\\n\\nportable luggage as they had brought in their hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There, honey!” she said, as she placed a carpet bag in the other corner\\r\\n\\n\\nof the seat, where her lady sat, and spread a soft shawl doubled over\\r\\n\\n\\nit, “there, that will be a tolerable pillow for you when you want to lay\\r\\n\\n\\ndown. And here’s another shawl that’ll do to spread over you. And I\\r\\n\\n\\nreckon I might’s well take the lunching basket and umberella on to the\\r\\n\\n\\nseat with me. And, dear knows, it looks as if we was agoing to have all\\r\\n\\n\\nthe coach to ourselves, any way; so we had no call to pay for so many\\r\\n\\n\\nseats we might a had for nothing.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile mammy rambled on in this manner, apparently for no other purpose\\r\\n\\n\\nthan the pleasure of hearing the sound of her own voice, Drusilla sat\\r\\n\\n\\ngazing out of the window at her own pretty little carriage, with her\\r\\n\\n\\nfaithful boy perched upon the coachman’s seat. Poor Leo was waiting to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee his beloved mistress off before leaving the spot.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now let me see—whar shall I put this ’ere bundle so I won’t forget\\r\\n\\n\\nit? And here, ma’am, you better take this purty little reticule o’ yours\\r\\n\\n\\nin with you, ’cause——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nurse,” said Drusilla, drawing in her head, “you had better sit down\\r\\n\\n\\nand be still. The coach is about to start.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, so I will, soon’s ever I find a convenient place for these\\r\\n\\n\\ngum shoes in case we have to get out in the wet, ’cause you see, honey—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe sudden starting of the coach stopped mammy’s oration short by\\r\\n\\n\\njerking her forward upon her hands and knees.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor’ a massy upon me! This is a pretty beginning, isn’t it now? if it’s\\r\\n\\n\\nall agoing to be like this!” grumbled mammy, as she gathered herself up,\\r\\n\\n\\nand reeled to and fro with the swinging action of the coach before she\\r\\n\\n\\ncould recover her equilibrium and take her seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, who was looking out of the window, and waving her hand in a\\r\\n\\n\\nlast adieu to her poor devoted servant, did not perceive mammy’s\\r\\n\\n\\nsummersault or her complaints.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coach swung on at a fearful rate until it reached Fourteenth street,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere it stopped at the great hotel there.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I s’pects here’s where they’re gwine to pick up the other passenger,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich sorry enough am I for it as anybody else should be intruding upon\\r\\n\\n\\nus,” said mammy, folding her arms and sitting up as if she had been in\\r\\n\\n\\nher own private equipage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Drusilla lay back in her corner, not even caring enough about her\\r\\n\\n\\nunknown fellow-passenger to turn her eyes towards the sidewalk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA tall young man, wrapped in a dark cloak, with its collar turned up\\r\\n\\n\\naround his face, and wearing a cap pulled low over his brow, came out of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe hotel, followed by a porter with some luggage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe luggage was put into the boot behind. The young man climbed up on\\r\\n\\n\\ntop.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, a outside passenger, after all, thank goodness,” said mammy,\\r\\n\\n\\nreposing herself cautiously back upon the cushions to avoid another jar\\r\\n\\n\\nas the horses started.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coach thundered down Fourteenth street south, and onward until it\\r\\n\\n\\nreached the foot of the Long Bridge, where it slackened speed, as “the\\r\\n\\n\\nlaw directs.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAh, Heaven! what pleasing, painful memories were awakened in the poor\\r\\n\\n\\nchild’s mind and heart by the sight of this old bridge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUpon just such a day and hour as this she had crossed it for the first\\r\\n\\n\\ntime. Then as now, the gorgeous crimson rays of the afternoon sun blazed\\r\\n\\n\\ndown upon the river, and the wintry wooded shores were reflected in deep\\r\\n\\n\\nshadows along the reddened waters. Then as now, the scene was\\r\\n\\n\\ntransfigured by the hour into supernal beauty and glory.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut _then_ she was a newly made and blessed bride, seated by her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband’s side and going to share his home and bless his life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nScarcely eleven months had passed, and now, now she was recrossing the\\r\\n\\n\\nsame river, gazing on the same scene, at the same hour,—a deserted wife\\r\\n\\n\\nthough an expectant mother—a nearly heart-broken woman because an\\r\\n\\n\\naccusing spirit, going to confront her husband, and confound his\\r\\n\\n\\ncriminal plans. And at this hour on the morrow, where should she be? At\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Lyon Hall, bringing exposure and shame upon her guilty but still\\r\\n\\n\\ndear Alick—bringing mortification and sorrow to his expectant young\\r\\n\\n\\nbride—spreading consternation and gloom among the gay wedding guests.\\r\\n\\n\\nCould she bear to do this? But perhaps at this hour to-morrow she might\\r\\n\\n\\nbe dead and “past her pain,” for who could say whether she would have\\r\\n\\n\\nstrength to live through the terrors of the scene she was so resolved to\\r\\n\\n\\nbrave?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer mournful reverie was interrupted by mammy. The slow motion of the\\r\\n\\n\\ncoach was favorable to conversation, and mammy loved to let her tongue\\r\\n\\n\\nrun.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You see that sunset, don’t you, ma’am?” asked the old woman, pointing\\r\\n\\n\\nto where the sun was slowly sinking behind some long black clouds that\\r\\n\\n\\nlay along the summits of the western hills.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I see them.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That means bad weather, ma’am. All the good Indy summer goes down with\\r\\n\\n\\nthat sun, ma’am. You may take my ’sperience for that. We gwine to have\\r\\n\\n\\nrain and wind, and may be snow and sleet. For my part I pray to the Lord\\r\\n\\n\\nas we may reach our journey’s end before it comes too severe. When does\\r\\n\\n\\nyou expect to get there, ma’am?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Some time to-morrow afternoon or evening; I do not exactly know the\\r\\n\\n\\nhour.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coach reached the western terminus of the bridge, passed quietly\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough it, and then rapidly increasing its speed, thundered onward over\\r\\n\\n\\nthe rough old turnpike road.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTrees, houses, farms, forests flew past as the coach whirled onward up\\r\\n\\n\\nhill and down dale, until it reached Alexandria.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt drew up in the midst of the old town, before its office, took the\\r\\n\\n\\naddress of the single passenger for whom it was directed to call,\\r\\n\\n\\nchanged horses for a fresh start, and swung around into Duke street.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat was it here that suddenly aroused Drusilla from her painful\\r\\n\\n\\nabsorption in her own troubled thoughts?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coach drew up before the house in which she had been married!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe let down her veil, and, growing rapidly red and pale with\\r\\n\\n\\nexcitement, looked out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSoon the door opened, and the young minister—the very one who had\\r\\n\\n\\nperformed her marriage ceremony—came out, carpet bag in hand, and shawl\\r\\n\\n\\nover his shoulders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You see I am quite punctual,” he said, speaking to the gentleman\\r\\n\\n\\npassenger on top.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe other did not reply, but probably made a sign, for the minister\\r\\n\\n\\nnodded pleasantly, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes. I am coming up there to sit by you. Besides, the night is so fine\\r\\n\\n\\nit would be a pity to box one’s self up inside.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd with this the reverend traveller climbed to his place, and the coach\\r\\n\\n\\nstarted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla sat back in her corner and drew aside her veil. Then she saw at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe same moment mammy draw her head in from the other window and raise\\r\\n\\n\\nher eyes with a look of astonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, if that don’t beat Injuns!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What, nurse?” inquired Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, honey, that gentleman as has just got up on top, is the Reberend\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Hopper.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have known him, then,” said Drusilla, with awakened interest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hi, honey, why wouldn’t I know my own pastors and masters and sponsors\\r\\n\\n\\nin baptism? Sure I does know him, good too. Didn’t I sit underneaf of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis preaching ebber since here he’s been till I come to lib long o’ you?\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat you talking ’bout, honey? I knows him good as I do my own chillun.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is he an Alexandria man?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh lor, no, honey, not he! He comes from the northud and hasn’t been in\\r\\n\\n\\nthese here parts moren’ a year; no, nor come to think of it, that long,\\r\\n\\n\\nnyther; ’cause I ’members well, he come the first of last Janivary as\\r\\n\\n\\nebber was.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then,” thought Drusilla to herself, “he could not have been but a few\\r\\n\\n\\ndays in the State before he married Alick and me.” And speaking aloud,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe asked—“What did you say his name was, nurse? I have forgotten.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hopper, child! Mr. Hopper, honey; the Reberent Mr. Hopper; which\\r\\n\\n\\nwhoever heard tell of a reberent gentleman of the name o’ Hopper, which\\r\\n\\n\\nto my thinking is more besuited a dancing-master, or a skipping-jack nor\\r\\n\\n\\na Methody minis’er. But so it is, honey; and I ’spose people aint to be\\r\\n\\n\\nblamed for their misfortnit names. But what _I_ would like to know is,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat he gwine prowlywowling ’bout the country for?” said mammy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla shared her curiosity, though she did not answer it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What, indeed, could be taking this young Methodist minister, who had\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried her to Alick, and who could testify to the validity of the\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage? What _could_ be taking him on the same day, by the same\\r\\n\\n\\nconveyance, on the same journey with herself? Could his errand have any\\r\\n\\n\\nconnection with Alick’s approaching iniquitous marriage, or with his\\r\\n\\n\\nprior one? Indeed it looked so.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, nonsense, I am morbid and fanciful; the minister who married us\\r\\n\\n\\nhappens to be journeying at the same time and in the same coach with\\r\\n\\n\\nmyself, and I jump to the conclusion that he is going to the like place\\r\\n\\n\\non the like business. What a weak fool my sorrows have made me, to be\\r\\n\\n\\nsure,” said Drusilla to herself, taking her imagination to task for its\\r\\n\\n\\nvagaries.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she could not quite stop its wanderings.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what, honey, the night is a going to be a bad one. Them\\r\\n\\n\\nclouds over there is a banking up like mountains of soot. And the most\\r\\n\\n\\n_I_ care for is this:—it will drive them there passengers from the top\\r\\n\\n\\nto the inside, to moilest us,” said mammy, drawing her head in from the\\r\\n\\n\\nwindow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, they have a right to come, nurse. You would not keep them out in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe rain all night, would you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; that I would; ’cause I want to have the coach all to ourselves,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid mammy, positively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was quite dark and very cloudy when the coach reached the little,\\r\\n\\n\\nrural town of Drainsville, where the horses were to be changed and the\\r\\n\\n\\npassengers were to take tea.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, honey; les us get out,” said mammy, hiding away some of her\\r\\n\\n\\ntreasures, while she loaded herself with others.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think I would rather stay here, nurse,” said Drusilla, languidly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, no, no,” objected mammy, authoritatively, “not at all. I can’t\\r\\n\\n\\nallow it. The coach will be here for a good half an hour. You get out,\\r\\n\\n\\nand come in the house, and walk about a little to stretch your limbs;\\r\\n\\n\\nand take off your bonnet to ease your head, and have your tea\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfortable. It will freshen you up a heap for the rest of the journey.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And the goodness gracious alive knows as you _need_ freshening up, and\\r\\n\\n\\nyou won’t get another chance till the stage stops at Frostville to\\r\\n\\n\\nbreakfast. And that will be a good twelve hour long. Think of that, now,\\r\\n\\n\\nand do as I ’vises of you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore mammy was half through her exordium, Drusilla, convinced by her\\r\\n\\n\\neloquence, had risen to her feet, and was drawing her cloak around her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe saw through the darkness her fellow-travellers from the top get off\\r\\n\\n\\nand go into the bar-room of the neat and comfortable inn. And she gave\\r\\n\\n\\nher hand to the guard, who kindly came around to help her to alight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There, Miss, there is the private door—a nice place, Miss, with a nice\\r\\n\\n\\nlandlady and a good table; shall I take you in, Miss?” he inquired,\\r\\n\\n\\nhoisting a large umbrella, for it was now beginning to rain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks, yes,” returned Drusilla, “the ground seems slippery.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This way, if you please, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bad manners to your imperence, this lady is a married lady, and not a\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung Miss,” said mammy, indignantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beg pardon; but I thought the madam _looked_ young,” said the guard,\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughing, yet not disrespectfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe took her safely across the slippery way, and showed her into a neat,\\r\\n\\n\\nwell warmed and lighted parlor, where the table was cleanly set for tea.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe landlady, a cheerful, hospitable looking person, as a landlady\\r\\n\\n\\nshould be, came to meet her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Would you like to go to a bedroom, ma’am?” inquired the smiling\\r\\n\\n\\nhostess, who was led into no mistake by the child face of her guest,\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause her quick and experienced eye had discovered the truth at a\\r\\n\\n\\nglance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, please,” answered Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd preceded by the landlady and followed by the nurse, she was taken up\\r\\n\\n\\nstairs to a large bed room, whose red carpet, white walls and draperies,\\r\\n\\n\\nand bright fire, gave it a very pleasant aspect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla sauntered about, enjoying the privilege of locomotion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You’ll have tea, I suppose, ma’am?” inquired the hostess.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, please; and I will have it here,” answered Drusilla, as she took\\r\\n\\n\\noff her bonnet and laid it on the table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe landlady left the room to issue orders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile waiting for her tea, Drusilla washed her face and took down her\\r\\n\\n\\nhair and combed it out, and then did it up loosely in a net, so that she\\r\\n\\n\\nwould be able to lie down and sleep with it so. Then she made the\\r\\n\\n\\nfastenings of her clothing easy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd by the time she had finished preparing her toilet for the night\\r\\n\\n\\njourney, a maid-servant appeared with a tablecloth and tea tray.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla drank two cups of tea, for she was feverishly thirsty. And\\r\\n\\n\\nthen, being scolded into the measure by mammy, who assured her that two\\r\\n\\n\\nlives depended on her feeding, she ate a buttered muffin, and the breast\\r\\n\\n\\nof a boiled chicken with cream sauce.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, in the child-like simplicity of her heart, would have made her\\r\\n\\n\\nnurse sit down to the table and partake her supper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut mammy asserted that she—Aunt Hector—knew her place. And so she\\r\\n\\n\\nfilled the slop bowl brimming full of tea, piled up a plate with three\\r\\n\\n\\nquarters of the chicken and half a dozen muffins, went off to a distant\\r\\n\\n\\ncorner of the room, seated herself upon an old chest, ranged her supper\\r\\n\\n\\naround her, and, with a promptness and dispatch that made her mistress\\r\\n\\n\\nstare, she dispatched all these edibles, and announced herself in\\r\\n\\n\\ncondition to pursue her journey.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now if the coach is ready, I is.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut if mammy and the coach were both ready, the passengers at the\\r\\n\\n\\ntea-table down stairs were not; but the coach was not so very strictly\\r\\n\\n\\nconfined to time, and so it was a good quarter of an hour longer, and\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla had ample leisure to put on her bonnet, and to pay her bill,\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore she and her attendant were summoned to take their places.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe guard kindly and carefully assisted the delicate young matron into\\r\\n\\n\\nher corner of the back seat, saying that he would warn the other\\r\\n\\n\\npassengers who were coming in for the night that the whole of it\\r\\n\\n\\nbelonged to her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe thanked him, and then called to her nurse to make haste and enter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, honey, yes; I’m coming just as soon’s ever I catch my eyes on them\\r\\n\\n\\ntwo little red morocky trunks, which I haven’t seen ’em since we left\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexandry,” said mammy, who was behind the coach, engaged in a sharp\\r\\n\\n\\nargument with both coachman and hostler.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I tell you, woman,” said the former, “the blamed red trunks is all\\r\\n\\n\\nright. They is inside of the boot, kivered over with the ile skin to\\r\\n\\n\\nkeep out the wet.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, so you say; but I’d a heap rather see ’em with my own two looking\\r\\n\\n\\neyes. And believe you I won’t till I does,” snapped mammy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There then, blast you, look for yourself,” said the hostler, pulling\\r\\n\\n\\napart the leathern flaps of the boot.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy peeped through the aperture, and seeing the treasure safe, she\\r\\n\\n\\nsmiled and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank ye, sir. Sorry to give you trouble; but seeing is believing, and\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing short of it aint.—Yes, honey; yes, honey, I’m coming now!” she\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed, in answer to her lady’s repeated summonses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy tumbled up into the coach with even more than her usual blundering\\r\\n\\n\\nawkwardness; for it was as dark as Tophet, and the guard did not seem to\\r\\n\\n\\nconsider it necessary to hold a light to such a refractory passenger.\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so mammy, after fumbling blindly about to find the seat she had\\r\\n\\n\\nformerly occupied, turned and dropped herself heavily down upon a\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman’s lap. A simultaneous—\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA cry of pain from the victim and of surprise from the oppressor arose.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Beg pardon, sir, I’m sure; but I’m a heavy ole ’oman, and you shouldn’t\\r\\n\\n\\na hit up agin me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hit up agin you! Oh!” exclaimed the injured party, in a tragi-comic\\r\\n\\n\\ngroan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt the sound of his voice Drusilla started violently, and lowered her\\r\\n\\n\\nveil; though in fact it was too dark either to see or to be seen; for\\r\\n\\n\\noh! with what a thrill of vague dread she recognized Dick Hammond’s\\r\\n\\n\\ntones, although she could not discern his face!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I wish you wouldn’t yowl out in that onyearthly way, sir; you’ll\\r\\n\\n\\ndisturb a deliky lady I has in my charge,” expostulated mammy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I’ll roar you softly an’ it were a sucking dove, and bear my\\r\\n\\n\\ntortures with the patience of a slaughtered lamb,” laughed Dick, in a\\r\\n\\n\\nlachrymose manner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope it aint as bad as all that, sir. Take a sup o’ brandy out of my\\r\\n\\n\\nbottle,” said mammy, feeling about all the vacant seats with her big\\r\\n\\n\\nhands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt this instant the coach started so suddenly with such a violent lurch,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat mammy was jerked back, and precipitated upon the knees of the\\r\\n\\n\\nunlucky Dick. And in scrambling upon her feet she laid hold of his hair\\r\\n\\n\\nto help herself up by.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Outch!” screeched the victim. “She’s finished me now. She has scalped\\r\\n\\n\\nme and broken both my legs. I know they’ll have to be amputated!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very sorry, sir, I’m sure,” said mammy, as she reeled about with the\\r\\n\\n\\nswinging of the coach, and finally dropped into a vacant seat. “Very\\r\\n\\n\\nsorry, but you _will_ keep a hitting up agin me. I hope you aint hurt\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hurt much? I tell you you have crushed both my knees to a pulp, and I\\r\\n\\n\\nknow I shall have to get them taken off.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very sorry, sir! but I can recommend you to a doctor as saws legs off\\r\\n\\n\\nbeautiful, and likewise to a upholster who sells elegant wooden ones,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid mammy, sympathetically.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Many thanks! But how about my head? You have pulled two great handfuls\\r\\n\\n\\nof hair out by the roots, and I know I shall have to get the rest\\r\\n\\n\\nshaved!” laughed and groaned Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, I can direct you to a gentleman of the barbarous line of\\r\\n\\n\\nbusiness, who will shave your head as clean as a peeled potaty, and sell\\r\\n\\n\\nyou a lovely false wig.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A million of gratitudes! When I require your valuable guidance I will\\r\\n\\n\\nseek it. But for the present, I begin to suspect that my limbs were not\\r\\n\\n\\nquite crushed, but only benumbed; and instead of being scalped outright\\r\\n\\n\\nI have only lost a handful of hair,” said Dick, as he settled himself\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfortably in his seat, and subsided into silence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How does you feel now, honey? Is you comformerble?” inquired mammy, in\\r\\n\\n\\na low tone, addressing her charge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe received no answer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do b’lieve how she’s sleep. How is you getting along, honey?”\\r\\n\\n\\nrepeated mammy. But with no better success.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I do ’spose she _is_ ’sleep! But, Lor’, I daren’t go nearer to her to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee for fear I should fall on her, and mash her, which would be\\r\\n\\n\\ndreadful. Tell me if you is asleep, honey; ’cause if you is I won’t wake\\r\\n\\n\\nyou up,” said mammy, raising her voice, and listening attentively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut still she received no reply,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wonder what’s the matter with her?” muttered mammy, uneasily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She’s asleep,” answered Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, if she’s ’sleep, why couldn’t she tell me so when I axed her?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She has told you so,” replied Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor’! why she hasn’t said a single word!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; but she has told you so in the only way a sleeper could,—by her\\r\\n\\n\\nsilence. If she had been awake, she would have spoken; wouldn’t she?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sure enough; I never thought of that before. See what it is to have a\\r\\n\\n\\nhead-piece. But is you sartain sure she is asleep?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Certain sure,” answered Dick, bending forward, and listening to the\\r\\n\\n\\nsoft, low, regular breathing of his invisible fellow-passenger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, thank Goodness for that!” said mammy, as she settled herself to\\r\\n\\n\\nrest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe stage-coach had been thundering on its way at a tremendous rate for\\r\\n\\n\\nseveral miles, but now it had to cross a broad but shallow stream and to\\r\\n\\n\\ngo slowly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSuddenly, Dick yawned, and then, addressing his fat neighbor, inquired:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Does your ladyship object to smoking?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” replied mammy, sharply; “my ladyship _do_ very much so,\\r\\n\\n\\nindeed; and so do my missus,—which, sleeping or ’waking, I believe it\\r\\n\\n\\nwould make her sick.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, your missus! True? Well, let’s see what sort of weather it is\\r\\n\\n\\noutside—though, in point of fact, I had rather bear the rain than\\r\\n\\n\\nforbear my cigar,” said Dick, as he opened the window and looked forth\\r\\n\\n\\ninto the blackness of the night.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe rain had ceased and the clouds had parted as with the promise of\\r\\n\\n\\nclearing off entirely. A few stars were shining out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come; not so bad a night after all. I have been out in worse. And as\\r\\n\\n\\nsoon as we get upon dry land again, I think I will climb up on top and\\r\\n\\n\\ntake a smoke. Eh, what do you say, Aunty? Shall I help you up also? I\\r\\n\\n\\nknow you’d like your pipe!” said Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I scorn your insiniwations, sir, and I ’vises of you, if you is agoing\\r\\n\\n\\nout in the damp night air, as you’d better take care and not get cold in\\r\\n\\n\\nyour ‘raw head and bloody bones,’ as you was a-complaining of.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks for your caution, Aunty. I shall be sure to profit by it,”\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then as the coach was slowly crawling out of the mud that bordered\\r\\n\\n\\nthe shallow stream, he called the coachman to halt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I wish to get up on top,” said Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd when the man complied with his wishes, Dick left his seat and went\\r\\n\\n\\nup.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere now remained two other passengers besides Drusilla and her\\r\\n\\n\\nattendant. These were two gentlemen that occupied the corners of the\\r\\n\\n\\nfront seat, with their backs to the horses. But they sat so quietly that\\r\\n\\n\\nbut for their breathing and an occasional cough or low-toned word, mammy\\r\\n\\n\\nwould have been unconscious of their presence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd now Drusilla bent forward and cautiously touched the nurse, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwhispered:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mammy, come and sit by me. I have something to say to you. Don’t answer\\r\\n\\n\\nme aloud, but do as I tell you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lor’, honey, is you waked up? It was that there man a-making of his\\r\\n\\n\\nnoise, getting outn’t his seat. Some people can’t never keep quiet. But,\\r\\n\\n\\nhoney, I’m afraid if I moves I might fall on you,” said mammy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, you won’t; we have no jolts here. Guide yourself by the left side\\r\\n\\n\\nof the seat, and I will give you my hand.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, honey,” said the old woman, and slowly and carefully she changed\\r\\n\\n\\nher “base,” and safely reached the haven beside her mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nurse,” whispered Drusilla, “I have not been asleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My! haven’t you, honey? Why didn’t you answer me, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because I did not wish to talk. That gentleman who got in just the\\r\\n\\n\\nmoment before you, is a passenger that was picked up at Drainsville, he\\r\\n\\n\\nis the same person who brought me the bad news yesterday.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Don’t say!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush! speak very low; we are not alone, you know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And to think I never knowed him agin.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is not strange. It is quite too dark for you to have seen his\\r\\n\\n\\nface. I only knew him by his voice.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I heard his woice too; but I didn’t know it agin.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You heard it only in a moment of terror, and when its very sound was\\r\\n\\n\\nunnatural. It is not strange that you should not have recognized it\\r\\n\\n\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, I’m sure! Where’s he going?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know, nurse. Probably where _we_ are going. But I do not wish\\r\\n\\n\\nhim to recognize _me_, lest he should like me to talk; and I cannot talk\\r\\n\\n\\nof my affairs. I say this to caution you. Be on you guard.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, honey, I’ll be on my guard. And you may keep yourself dark during\\r\\n\\n\\nthe night; but I don’t see how you gwine to manage when it is daylight.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I must keep my veil down,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, honey, I hope you will succeed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XLIV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                             HOW SHE SPED.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n           The night drave on * * *\\r\\n\\n\\n           The wind blew as ’twad blaun its last,\\r\\n\\n\\n           The rattling showers rushed on the blast,\\r\\n\\n\\n           The speedy gleams the darkness swallowed.\\r\\n\\n\\n           Deep, lang and loud the tempest bellowed,\\r\\n\\n\\n           From heav’n the clouds pour all their floods,\\r\\n\\n\\n           The doubling storm roars through the woods.—BURNS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLight here and there, like sparks of fire in seas of darkness. Darkness\\r\\n\\n\\nwithin and without. The two red lamps that flanked the coachman’s seat,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe single lantern carried by the guard, and the bright point of Dick’s\\r\\n\\n\\ncigar as he sat smoking on the top of the coach, only seemed by contrast\\r\\n\\n\\nto make that darkness deeper.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coach slowly clawed up a long hill at the summit of which was a\\r\\n\\n\\ncountry inn, with its usual accessories of grocery-store, blacksmith’s\\r\\n\\n\\nshop and post-office.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere all was cheerful bustle, with the glancing lights, the voices of\\r\\n\\n\\nmen, the tramp of steeds, and all the merry movement of a way station.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd here the coach stopped to change horses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe outside passenger jumped down and went into the little bar-room of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe inn, which Drusilla could see from her window was half filled with\\r\\n\\n\\ncountry loafers and village politicians, drinking, smoking, discussing\\r\\n\\n\\nthe news, and settling the elections. In two minutes the outside\\r\\n\\n\\npassenger was “hail fellow, well met,” with every one of them, and\\r\\n\\n\\ngenerously treating the whole company with the best in the bar. Ah, poor\\r\\n\\n\\nDick!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile the guard came to the coach door with his lantern, and\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired if any of the ladies or gentlemen desired to get out for\\r\\n\\n\\nrefreshments, as they should stop there fifteen minutes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe two gentlemen on the front seat at once left the coach. As they got\\r\\n\\n\\nout, Drusilla saw that one was the Reverend Mr. Hopper. The other was\\r\\n\\n\\nthe stranger they had taken up first in Washington.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen they had disappeared, the guard turned to Drusilla and repeated his\\r\\n\\n\\nquestion, whether she or her attendant would like to leave the coach.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla politely declined to do so. But mammy got up and tumbled out of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe coach, and called to one of the hostlers;\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hey! I say! Come here, you sir, and fetch a light this way.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe man who was thus summoned, thinking that some accident had happened,\\r\\n\\n\\nran to the spot, demanding:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I want you just to look in that there leather place behind, and see if\\r\\n\\n\\nthem there little red morocky trunks is all right.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Blast you and your trunks too! Who do you think is going to be bothered\\r\\n\\n\\nwith them?” angrily retorted the man as he left her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come in, nurse. Oh, _do_ come in,” pleaded Drusilla, from the window.\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am _sure_ the trunks are all safe.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut mammy was not in a very compliant humor. She ran splashing through\\r\\n\\n\\nslop and mire, and burst into the bar-room, exclaiming:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, do, kind gentlemen, some of you come out and see if them there two\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle red morocky trunks of the madam’s is all right.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe company around the fire stared at her in astonishment and ridicule.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Dick, the most good-natured of all creatures, took up a light and\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowed her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Here, sir,” she said, leading the way to the boot, “just you pull apart\\r\\n\\n\\nthese here flaps and hold the light so I can peep in and see.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick laughingly complied with her request.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, there they is, thank goodness, safe as _yet_. Thanky’ sir. Now\\r\\n\\n\\nI’ll get in the coach, please,” she said, with a courtesy as she\\r\\n\\n\\nreturned to the side of her charge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Is it raining?” inquired Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, honey, but black as Beelzebub; so it must come down heavy enough\\r\\n\\n\\nafore long. And now, honey, while them there men is all out’n the way\\r\\n\\n\\nlet me make you comfortable for the night. You come over on this middle\\r\\n\\n\\nseat while I make you a bed on the back one.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla complied, for she was very, very weary with sitting up so long.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy, with the help of a softly-packed carpet bag, that served for a\\r\\n\\n\\npillow, with a clean pocket handkerchief spread over it for a case, and\\r\\n\\n\\ntwo large shawls for coverings, made a very comfortable couch.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla took off her bonnet and hung it up, and loosened her hair and\\r\\n\\n\\nher clothes, and lay down. And mammy tucked her up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJust at this moment came the guard with a tray and a tumbler.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“One of the gentlemen from the inn has sent this to the lady with his\\r\\n\\n\\nrespectful compliments, and begs she will take it,” he said, as he\\r\\n\\n\\nhanded the oiler in at the window.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, honey, you take it, and drink it, too. It’s a hot mulled port wine\\r\\n\\n\\nnegus, spiced; and it will warm you and put you to sleep,” said mammy,\\r\\n\\n\\nas she took the glass from the messenger and passed it to the mistress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe poor, chilled, tired and nervous creature really needed and felt\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she needed just such a cordial at just that hour. She inhaled its\\r\\n\\n\\nsteamy, spicy fragrance with satisfaction and desire, yet she hesitated\\r\\n\\n\\nto take it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know who sent it, nurse,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now what the mischief _that_ got to do with it? Do _that_ make it\\r\\n\\n\\nhotter or worse? I s’pect the good-natured young man who ’cused me o’\\r\\n\\n\\nscalping him and breaking of his legs sent it. But that’s nyther here\\r\\n\\n\\nnor there. Whoever sent it, sent it in kindness; and don’t you ever\\r\\n\\n\\n’fuse human kindness when you needs it, come from where it will, ’cause\\r\\n\\n\\nit hurts the feelings in the saftest place. Here, honey, drink it while\\r\\n\\n\\nit’s steaming hot—hot as love.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said Drusilla, taking the glass and sipping the cordial, “when\\r\\n\\n\\nyou return the glass, send word to the gentleman that I thank him very\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch for his thoughtfulness in sending me this restorative, and that I\\r\\n\\n\\nknow it will do me good.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFive minutes after, when Drusilla, having finished her cordial, was\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfortably reposing on her couch, and the guard came for the glass,\\r\\n\\n\\nmammy delivered her message thus:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tell the young man as sent this that the madam says how she’s very much\\r\\n\\n\\nobleeged to him for the hot stuff, which it has gone right to the right\\r\\n\\n\\nplace, and done her good and no mistake.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe next moment the three gentlemen passengers took their places inside\\r\\n\\n\\nthe coach, two of them sitting on the front seat in opposite corners,\\r\\n\\n\\nand one of them, Dick, sitting on the middle seat beside mammy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe coach started again. The night was so dark, and the down-hill road\\r\\n\\n\\nso steep, that its progress was cautiously slow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe male passengers wrapped themselves closely in their “mauds,” pulled\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir caps down over their eyes, and composed themselves to sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy opened her luncheon basket, and, having first hospitably offered\\r\\n\\n\\nto share its contents with each and all of her fellow-passengers and\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen politely refused, set to work and ate a very hearty supplementary\\r\\n\\n\\nsupper off the best it contained of food and drink, and then gathered up\\r\\n\\n\\nthe fragments and put them away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFinally, she took off her best bonnet—of the Quaker or Methodist\\r\\n\\n\\npattern,—hung it up beside her mistress’s, tied a little woollen shawl\\r\\n\\n\\nover her head, wrapped a big one around her shoulders, and resigned\\r\\n\\n\\nherself to rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSoon all were sleeping except Drusilla, who, physically speaking, was\\r\\n\\n\\nmore favorably placed for sleep than any of the others. She lay very\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfortably, really rocked, not racked, by the swinging motion of the\\r\\n\\n\\ncoach as it rolled down hill. She was very tired, and so, in a bodily\\r\\n\\n\\nsense, she almost enjoyed this soft reposing and easy rocking; but she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas not sleepy, for her mind was too active with the thoughts of what\\r\\n\\n\\nlay around and before her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhere was Dick Hammond and Mr. Hopper going? Who was the tall, dark\\r\\n\\n\\ngentleman they had taken up at Washington, and who certainly seemed to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe of the same party, since she had seen him signalling to Mr. Hopper?\\r\\n\\n\\nWas their errand in the country connected with the same sad business\\r\\n\\n\\nthat was taking herself thither?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick might be only going down in answer to his uncle’s invitation to the\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding, she reflected. “But, no, not so!” she thought, instantly\\r\\n\\n\\nrepudiating the idea that Richard Hammond, after all that he had said in\\r\\n\\n\\nreprobation of the iniquitous marriage, could possibly sanction it by\\r\\n\\n\\nhis presence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut what then was he going for? and why was he taking Mr. Hopper and\\r\\n\\n\\nthat other gentleman—who looked as if he were in some way connected with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe law, along with him?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWas he going to denounce Alick to his uncle and cousin? Was he taking\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Hopper down as a witness to Alick’s former marriage? And the\\r\\n\\n\\nmysterious legal-looking gentleman as a prosecutor?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs these thoughts chased themselves through her mind, she clasped her\\r\\n\\n\\nhands and moaned.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOh, were they all three combining to go and overwhelm her Alick, and\\r\\n\\n\\ncover him with humiliation and confusion? she asked herself; and for the\\r\\n\\n\\nmoment her Alick appeared to her, not as a criminal pursued by the just\\r\\n\\n\\navengers, but as a victim hunted down by relentless persecutors, of whom\\r\\n\\n\\nshe saw herself the chief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, why—oh, why couldn’t I have kept still and let him marry his cousin\\r\\n\\n\\nand be happy with her? Oh, Alick! oh, poor Alick! But that would have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen a crime. Ah, Heaven, how hard is my lot to have to choose between\\r\\n\\n\\nmaking him wretched or leaving him criminal!” she moaned, twisting her\\r\\n\\n\\nfingers and weeping.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe dreaded the coming of the morning. She feared the daylight that\\r\\n\\n\\nmight discover her face to these men, who she thought were confederated\\r\\n\\n\\nto ruin her husband. She dreaded their recognizing and speaking to her.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she was determined to have nothing to say to them, or to do with\\r\\n\\n\\nthem; for, under present circumstances she felt that any intercourse\\r\\n\\n\\nbetween her and them would look too much like entering into their\\r\\n\\n\\nconspiracy. And now her whole gentle soul revolted in horror from those\\r\\n\\n\\nthree harmless and unconscious gentlemen, who were reclining on the\\r\\n\\n\\nseats before her, and “sleeping the sleep of innocence.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nYes; all in the coach were at rest except herself. Nor could she, with\\r\\n\\n\\nall her mental distress, very long resist the influences that were\\r\\n\\n\\nwooing her to repose. Her excessive bodily fatigue, combined with the\\r\\n\\n\\nsoporific qualities of the spiced cordial she had taken, the swinging\\r\\n\\n\\nmotion of the coach and the lulling sound of the falling rain, soon\\r\\n\\n\\novercame her consciousness, and she too slumbered in forgetfulness of\\r\\n\\n\\nall her sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe slept on for several hours, until she was awakened by the flashing\\r\\n\\n\\nof lights, the hallooing of men and the trampling of beasts, as the\\r\\n\\n\\ncoach stopped to change horses at one of the nosiest post-houses on the\\r\\n\\n\\nroad.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe other passengers were aroused at the same time.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy awoke from some dream of her professional duties, yawned,\\r\\n\\n\\nstretching her jaws almost to dislocation, and thereby discovering a\\r\\n\\n\\nmost fearful abyss, and still dreaming, exclaiming:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yaw-aw! Yes, honey! Tell the madam I’ll be up and dressed in one\\r\\n\\n\\nminute. And tell that boy to run for the doctor. Ow! Yaw-aw!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut at this noisy station the people were very active. And before the\\r\\n\\n\\ngood woman could collect her faculties the coach started, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nherself was again precipitated down into the land of “Nod.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla could not sleep again, so to ease her position she sat up and\\r\\n\\n\\nreclined back in the corner of her seat, and in a dreamy, half-conscious\\r\\n\\n\\ncondition she gazed through the opposite window.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt first it seemed but a solid wall of darkness past which the coach was\\r\\n\\n\\nso swiftly whirling; but gradually, as her eyes accustomed themselves to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe circumstances, this darkness grew less opaque, this obscurity less\\r\\n\\n\\nimpenetrable, until at length she could dimly discern the boundaries of\\r\\n\\n\\nmountains, valleys, forests, and the outlines of rocks, trees and\\r\\n\\n\\nbuildings.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt long intervals she could perceive the form of some solitary\\r\\n\\n\\nfarm-house, with its barn, shed, cattle-pen, field, orchard and garden.\\r\\n\\n\\nHalf waking, she would wonder who lived and worked there; and half\\r\\n\\n\\nsleeping, she would people the place with the beings of her dream.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSometimes she saw a lonely woodcutter’s cottage on the edge of a forest,\\r\\n\\n\\nand vaguely conjectured what sort of life its denizens led. Once in such\\r\\n\\n\\na place she saw a single light burning in the tiny window of a little\\r\\n\\n\\nupper chamber, in the interior of which the shadow of a woman was\\r\\n\\n\\nbending over the shadow of a sick-bed. She had but a glimpse of all\\r\\n\\n\\nthis, as the coach rolled past, yet her ready sympathies went forth to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe poor watcher and the suffering invalid.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOnce she was treated to a brilliant picture in the darkness—an oasis in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe desert. It was a bran new, commodious country house, well seated on\\r\\n\\n\\na hill; lights were glancing from every window; music was borne forth\\r\\n\\n\\nupon the wind; even in that inclement weather, somebody seemed to be\\r\\n\\n\\ngiving a great party and to be keeping it up all night. But before she\\r\\n\\n\\ncould observe more the coach had rushed by and left the festive scene\\r\\n\\n\\nfar behind.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOnce she noticed a little road-side hut, and in its doorway, a poor, old\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman, thinly clad, holding a lantern in her hand and bending outward in\\r\\n\\n\\nan attitude of intense anxiety, as if looking for some one. “In her poor\\r\\n\\n\\nway, she is watching and waiting, as I used to do. Has she a husband, or\\r\\n\\n\\nperhaps a son, who is breaking her heart?” mused Drusilla, as the coach\\r\\n\\n\\nswung onward and left this sad picture also in its rear.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSuch signs of life, however, were very rare, on that lonely road, at\\r\\n\\n\\nthat late hour. The few hamlets, farms and huts they passed were for the\\r\\n\\n\\nmost part shut up, dark and silent as graves.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut they were now penetrating deeper and deeper into the mountain\\r\\n\\n\\nfastnesses; and farm-houses and villages were fewer and farther between.\\r\\n\\n\\nFor miles and miles nothing but the most savage solitudes loomed in the\\r\\n\\n\\nblackness of darkness through which they passed. And Drusilla, reclining\\r\\n\\n\\nback in her corner, dreamily gazing forth through the rain-dimmed window\\r\\n\\n\\nupon this obscure scene, vaguely wondered when these solitudes would be\\r\\n\\n\\npeopled, when this wilderness would “bloom and blossom as the rose.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so, while all her fellow-passengers were deeply buried in\\r\\n\\n\\nunconsciousness, she dreamed on her waking dream. But often in the midst\\r\\n\\n\\nof these reveries the sudden sharp recollection of her own trouble\\r\\n\\n\\npierced her heart like a sword and drew from her lips a bitter groan.\\r\\n\\n\\nThen again the influence of the scene and hour, the obscurity, the\\r\\n\\n\\npicturesqueness, the rocking motion of the coach, the soothing sound of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe falling rain without, the silence and stillness of all within,\\r\\n\\n\\nlulled her senses to repose if not to sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThus, slumbering, dreaming, starting, waking, she passed this weird\\r\\n\\n\\nnight, that ever in her after life seemed to her less like the reality\\r\\n\\n\\nthan like the phantasmagoria of a hasheesh-conjured vision.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTowards morning, being very much wearied with sitting up, she lay down\\r\\n\\n\\nagain, and, as is usual with uneasy sleepers, just at daylight she fell\\r\\n\\n\\ninto a deep and dreamless sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XLV.\\r\\n\\n\\n                          DRUSILLA’S ARRIVAL.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                  What shall she be ere night?—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe slept profoundly and until she was rudely awakened by a shock of\\r\\n\\n\\nnoise and action.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was now broad day, and it was raining hard. The coach was drawn up\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore the door of the large, low building, the one hotel in the\\r\\n\\n\\nmountain hamlet. Hostlers and porters were crowding around it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla lay quietly in her shadowy recess, resolved not to move until\\r\\n\\n\\nthe male passengers had left the stage, which she saw they were\\r\\n\\n\\npreparing to do.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFirst, Dick Hammond climbed over mammy, who was still fast asleep, and\\r\\n\\n\\ngot out. Then the minister and the lawyer, one after the other,\\r\\n\\n\\nsurmounted the same obstruction and passed on the same way. And these\\r\\n\\n\\nthree gentlemen went into the bar-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut mammy slept on.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla sat up and quickly tightened her own dress and put on her\\r\\n\\n\\nbonnet. And then she tried to wake her attendant, but without success;\\r\\n\\n\\nfor mammy did nothing but yawn and talk in her sleep and settle herself\\r\\n\\n\\nto rest again; until the guard came, and, shaking her roughly, shouted\\r\\n\\n\\nin her ears:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come, come, old woman! wake up and get out! the coach stops here to\\r\\n\\n\\nbreakfast.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yaw! yaw! I just said how it would be! I know’d it would happen before\\r\\n\\n\\nmorning!” said mammy, yawning fearfully and then opening her eyes and\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaiming:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, dear! why, what’s this? Where is we, to be sure? Oh, I members!\\r\\n\\n\\nThis must be Frostville. And now I wonder if them there little red\\r\\n\\n\\nmorocky trunks is safe?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes, nurse, of course they are safe. And now come and do let us\\r\\n\\n\\nget into the hotel as quickly as possible,” said Drusilla, impatiently,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor she saw that the people in charge of the stage were vexed at the\\r\\n\\n\\ndelay.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, Lor’, honey, is _you_ awake at last? Well, I declare! How sound\\r\\n\\n\\nyou _did_ sleep all night, to be sure! and a blessed thing for you, too;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut as for me, I couldn’t close my eyes all the whole night, for\\r\\n\\n\\nwatching of you, and thinking of them there two little red morocky\\r\\n\\n\\ntrunks. I wonder if they _is_ safe,” said mammy, uneasily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes, blame you! Come, get out! I can’t stop here waiting on you\\r\\n\\n\\nall day,” said the guard, half angrily. And with very little ceremony he\\r\\n\\n\\nbundled the old woman out of the coach.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then he hoisted an umbrella, and held it over the delicate young\\r\\n\\n\\ninvalid as he helped her to alight, and led her across to the private\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor of the hotel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy followed, dragging all her belongings, and grumbling:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I haven’t seen them there little red morocky trunks yet, which it is my\\r\\n\\n\\nprivate belief that the guards is in league with the highway robbers,\\r\\n\\n\\nsame as they say the p’lice is with the burglarians in the towns; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthey ’wides spiles, share and share alike, that I do. Goodness knows,\\r\\n\\n\\none needs to have one’s eyes all around one’s head, and all of ’em wide\\r\\n\\n\\nopen all the time, to watch these fellers.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nurse, be quiet. The trunks are safe; or, if they are not, the loss is\\r\\n\\n\\nmine,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The loss may be yours, but the illconweniency is mine, ma’am. How in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe world am I to do my perfessional dooty without my proper\\r\\n\\n\\nconveniences?” inquired mammy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut before her question could be answered, the guard had conducted her\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress into the best parlor of the humble hotel.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a very pleasant place to come into out of the rain; a spacious\\r\\n\\n\\nroom with a low ceiling, and an ample fire-place with a huge fire of\\r\\n\\n\\npine and oak wood roaring and blazing up the chimney; on the floor a\\r\\n\\n\\nhome made carpet; at the windows, home made blue paper blinds; along the\\r\\n\\n\\nwalls, country manufactured chip-bottomed chairs and chintz-covered\\r\\n\\n\\nsofas; over the wooden mantel-piece, the oldest fashioned looking-glass,\\r\\n\\n\\nornamented with peacock’s feathers;—altogether it was a room breathing\\r\\n\\n\\nof real rustic life, and very refreshing after velvet carpets, satin\\r\\n\\n\\ndamask draperies, gilded chairs, and cheval mirrors.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMany doors opened from this large, low parlor into many other rooms, for\\r\\n\\n\\nin this mountain region the houses were all built on one floor and of\\r\\n\\n\\none story, to protect them from injury by the high winds of that\\r\\n\\n\\nlocality.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla stood for a little while before this beautiful fire, basking in\\r\\n\\n\\nits genial warmth; and then to relieve her long cramped limbs, she\\r\\n\\n\\nwalked up and down the cheerful room and looked through the windows upon\\r\\n\\n\\nthe busy scene without, in which landlord, postmaster, coachman, guard\\r\\n\\n\\nand hostlers seemed all to take an important part.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTired of this view, she turned from the windows, and then, from an open\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor on the left side of the fire-place, she had a view of the long\\r\\n\\n\\ncoffee-room, in which was set forth a very inviting breakfast. There all\\r\\n\\n\\nher fellow-passengers, as well as many other persons, were impatiently\\r\\n\\n\\nwaiting for the signal to sit down to the table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla not wishing to join this company, went to the bell and rang it\\r\\n\\n\\nperemptorily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA chamber-maid answered the summons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can I have a bedroom at once?” inquired the lady.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, ma’am, certainly. This way, if you please,” smiled the woman,\\r\\n\\n\\nopening one of the many doors and leading the way into an inner chamber\\r\\n\\n\\nof the same general character as the parlor, except that it was\\r\\n\\n\\nfurnished with a bed and a toilet table, with pure white dimity\\r\\n\\n\\nhangings, and a wash-stand with a plenty of fresh water and clean\\r\\n\\n\\ntowels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla threw herself into the white draperied easy chair, before the\\r\\n\\n\\nblazing wood-fire, and then inquired—\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can I have breakfast for myself and my attendant served here?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, ma’am, certainly,” assented the woman, in what seemed to be\\r\\n\\n\\nher stereotyped phrase.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I would like to have it soon, if you please,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl went away to execute her orders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, left alone with her nurse, laid off her bonnet, and bathed her\\r\\n\\n\\nface and hands and arranged her hair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile engaged in this refreshing process, she overheard voices speaking\\r\\n\\n\\nin the parlor she had just left.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey appeared to belong to Dick and his companions, and they seemed to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe discussing with the landlord the speediest manner in which to\\r\\n\\n\\nprosecute their journey.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You say the new Bee-line of coaches across country is started,\\r\\n\\n\\nlandlord?” spoke Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir; started on Monday. The road was first opened on Saturday.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“At what hour do they pass here?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“At half-past ten, sir, almost to a minute.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And they pass directly through Hammondsville?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Directly, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And Hammondsville is within six or eight miles of Old Lyon Hall, while\\r\\n\\n\\nSaulsburg is nine or ten miles off. Besides, at Hammondsville, I shall\\r\\n\\n\\nbe near enough to my place, Hammond Hill, to get my own horses, with\\r\\n\\n\\naltogether a better chance of reaching our destination to-night. Come! I\\r\\n\\n\\nhave a good mind to have my luggage taken off, and to wait for the\\r\\n\\n\\nBee-line coach. What do you say, gentlemen!” inquired Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I say that we had best first be sure that we can get places in the new\\r\\n\\n\\ncoach before we give up our seats in the old one. ‘A bird in the hand is\\r\\n\\n\\nworth two in the bush,’ you know,” answered the lawyer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What are the chances of our obtaining places, landlord?” inquired the\\r\\n\\n\\nclergyman.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How many places do you want, gentlemen?” inquired ‘my host.’\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Only three; and, rather than miss, we would not mind taking outside\\r\\n\\n\\nplaces.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, be at ease, sir; I can almost insure you places on these terms,\\r\\n\\n\\neither outside or inside. At this season of the year, the coaches are\\r\\n\\n\\nvery seldom crowded.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right!” said Dick, “I will go and have our luggage taken off this\\r\\n\\n\\none.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thank Heaven, we are going to lose our fellow-passengers!” exclaimed\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I thanks Heaven, too, for that same. But long’s that young man’s gwine\\r\\n\\n\\nto have his luggidge took off I must go and see that he don’t get hold\\r\\n\\n\\nof them there two little red morocky trunks,” said mammy, starting off\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed you shall do no such thing,” said Drusilla, laying hold of her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But why musn’t I then?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Because in the first place the trunks are in no sort of danger.\\r\\n\\n\\nGentlemen are not thieves.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, indeed!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And in the second place, I would rather lose the whole of our luggage\\r\\n\\n\\nthan have that gentleman recognize you, as I believe he fortunately\\r\\n\\n\\nfailed to do last night. Sit down and keep quiet. I insist upon it,\\r\\n\\n\\nnurse!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old woman dropped down into a chair, grumbling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I’d like to know what we is to do if them there two little red\\r\\n\\n\\nmorocky trunks is lost or stolen!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The risk is mine alone, nurse. And now hush, for here is the waiter\\r\\n\\n\\ncome to lay the cloth for our breakfast,” said Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nVery soon a most delicious morning meal was laid before them—fragrant\\r\\n\\n\\ncoffee, maple-sugar, rich cream, hot rolls, fresh butter, venison\\r\\n\\n\\nsteaks, pure honey—luxuries to be found in their perfections only on the\\r\\n\\n\\nmountains.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy inhaled the aromas arising from this breakfast table as though\\r\\n\\n\\nevery breath was a delight. She coaxed and scolded her mistress into\\r\\n\\n\\nmaking a very good meal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then she made a very much better one herself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter this they prepared to resume their journey.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn going out to take her seat in the coach, Drusilla drew down her veil\\r\\n\\n\\nto avoid recognition, in any chance-meeting with Mr. Hammond. She need\\r\\n\\n\\nnot have done so, for poor Dick was in the bar-room treating his\\r\\n\\n\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe weather was worse than ever. From the clouds above the rain was\\r\\n\\n\\npouring in torrents; from the valleys below the vapors were rising in\\r\\n\\n\\nheavy fogs. The boundaries of the mountain scenery were lost in mist.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe day was as dim with a white obscurity as the night had been with a\\r\\n\\n\\nblack one.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla and her attendant had the inside of the coach all to themselves\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the next few hours.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, almost worn out with her journey, reclined at nearly full\\r\\n\\n\\nlength upon the back seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy, having asked and obtained leave, lay down upon the front seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe remainder of their journey passed monotonously enough, being varied\\r\\n\\n\\nonly by the stopping of the coach at the regular post-houses to change\\r\\n\\n\\nhorses, and by the altercations between mammy and the guard relative to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe safety of “them there two little red morocky trunks,” which the\\r\\n\\n\\nguard mentally consigned to the demon full fifty times before they\\r\\n\\n\\nreached their destination.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAbout noon they stopped to change horses at a small hamlet, where they\\r\\n\\n\\nwere joined by other passengers—two honest, good-humored-looking\\r\\n\\n\\ncountrymen, who immediately upon their entrance, began to talk of the\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat wedding which was to come off that same night at Old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFrom their talk Drusilla understood that she was approaching the\\r\\n\\n\\nneighborhood of the old manor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDeeply interested in the subject of their conversation, she first forced\\r\\n\\n\\nherself to listen calmly, and then to speak.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can you tell me how far we are from Old Lyon Hall?” she inquired of the\\r\\n\\n\\nelder man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, goodness, no, Miss, not exactly; though if I were to hazard a\\r\\n\\n\\nguess, I should say betwixt twenty and thirty miles, more or less,”\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered the man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is the nearest point at which the road passes the hall?” she next\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, for the life of me, Miss, I could not tell! But the nearest\\r\\n\\n\\nstopping-place is Saulsburg; and that’s pretty near twenty miles off\\r\\n\\n\\nhere, I know. Might you be going to the Old Hall, Miss?” inquired the\\r\\n\\n\\ntraveller, feeling quite free to follow her example and ask questions in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis turn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am going to Saulsburg,” answered Drusilla, evasively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah!—There’s to be a grand wedding at the old Hall to-night, Miss,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nthe traveller.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So I have heard,” coldly answered Drusilla, almost regretting that she\\r\\n\\n\\nhad opened a conversation with this traveller, and wishing now to close\\r\\n\\n\\nit.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the good man was well started on the great subject of the day and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe place, and he would talk of nothing but the wedding, and to nobody\\r\\n\\n\\nbut Drusilla, thinking, doubtless, that a lady, and a young lady too,\\r\\n\\n\\nwould be most likely to feel interested in the theme.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFortunately for Drusilla, her talkative fellow-passenger got out at the\\r\\n\\n\\nvery next stopping-place.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNow, having passed the greatest range of the mountains, they were coming\\r\\n\\n\\ninto a rather better settled portion of the country, and way-passengers\\r\\n\\n\\nwere getting in or out at every post-house; and the theme of\\r\\n\\n\\nconversation with every one of these was—not the crops, nor the races,\\r\\n\\n\\nnor the elections, but—the grand wedding to come off that night at old\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAbout three o’clock in the afternoon they reached the little hamlet of\\r\\n\\n\\nSaulsburg, consisting merely of a small inn and a half a dozen cottages,\\r\\n\\n\\nnestled at the foot of the Wild Mountain and upon the banks of the Wild\\r\\n\\n\\nRiver.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHere Drusilla and her attendant got out, in a pouring rain.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe kind-hearted guard hoisted his large umbrella, and led her into the\\r\\n\\n\\nshelter of the little inn parlor, and then went back to the coach to see\\r\\n\\n\\nto the removal of her luggage. He found mammy in high dispute with the\\r\\n\\n\\nporter—subject of debate, of course, “them there two little red morocky\\r\\n\\n\\ntrunks.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Here they are!” said the guard, as the treasures were taken from the\\r\\n\\n\\nboot and set upon the ground; “here they are, blast ’em, and I’m blowed\\r\\n\\n\\nif I don’t wish I may never set eyes on you or your blamed trunks again\\r\\n\\n\\nas long as ever I live in this world.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And so I sees my little red morocky trunks safe, I shan’t tear the\\r\\n\\n\\nclothes offen my back for grief if I never sees _you_ again; so there\\r\\n\\n\\nnow!” retorted mammy, as she loaded herself with shawls, carpet-bags,\\r\\n\\n\\nand umbrellas, and followed the porter who carried the precious little\\r\\n\\n\\ntrunks into the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe luggage was all set down in the hall, and, leaving it there, mammy\\r\\n\\n\\nwent into the parlor, where she found her mistress still in her\\r\\n\\n\\ntravelling dress, impatiently walking up and down the floor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I want to see the landlord, nurse. I have rung twice, but no one has\\r\\n\\n\\ncome. You go and try to find him and bring him here. I must have a\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage to convey me to Old Lyon Hall this afternoon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My goodness! ain’t you tired of travelling yet? And must you set off on\\r\\n\\n\\nanother journey again directly,” exclaimed mammy, in dismay.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am not at the end of my first journey yet, nurse, nor shall I be\\r\\n\\n\\nuntil I reach old Lyon Hall. It is there that I am bound. So go now and\\r\\n\\n\\ncall the landlord to me,” urged Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore mammy could either obey or expostulate, the landlord himself came\\r\\n\\n\\nin, in answer to Drusilla’s first summons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can I have a close carriage immediately, to take me to old Lyon Hall?”\\r\\n\\n\\nanxiously inquired Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe landlord looked surprised at such an unusual demand and, after\\r\\n\\n\\nstaring and rubbing his head, answered, slowly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, bless your heart, Miss, there ain’t such a thing as a close\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage in the whole willage!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, an open one then—any sort of one, so that it can be got ready at\\r\\n\\n\\nonce,” said Drusilla, impatiently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But there ain’t any sort of a carriage about the place, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A gig, then, a gig would do,” said Drusilla, eagerly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“We haven’t got such a thing, Miss.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good heavens, sir, I _must_ have some conveyance to take me to Old Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nHall this afternoon. I do not care what it costs!” said Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\ndesperately.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you’ll be on your way to the wedding there, Miss?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I am going there. Can you get me a conveyance of some sort\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom some one in the neighborhood? I will pay well for the use of any\\r\\n\\n\\nsort of a carriage to take me to the old hall. And I will pay you well\\r\\n\\n\\nfor your trouble in getting it for me. Answer, quickly—can you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear me, how anxious young folks is for weddings, to be sure!—Stay,\\r\\n\\n\\nlet’s see—Yes! There’s old Mr. Simpkins—he would hire his carryall, I\\r\\n\\n\\nknow, and glad to do it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Get it, then! I will pay whatever he asks. How long will it take you to\\r\\n\\n\\nget it?” asked Drusilla, breathlessly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, you see,” said the landlord, very leisurely, “Old man Simpkins he\\r\\n\\n\\nlives about a mile from here; and if I put a boy on horseback and send\\r\\n\\n\\nhim right off we might get the carryall here at the door inside of an\\r\\n\\n\\nhour.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do it then at once; pray hurry! I will pay you in proportion to the\\r\\n\\n\\nhaste that you make.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe leisurely landlord sauntered out of the parlor to give his\\r\\n\\n\\ndirections.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla paced up and down the floor in great excitement. The nearer she\\r\\n\\n\\ncame to her journey’s end the more anxious and agitated she felt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMammy stood and watched her in growing wonder. Suddenly mammy spoke out:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What wedding this they all talking ’bout? I thought we was agoing to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee a wery sick man, not a wedding.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps to see both, nurse! But pray do not talk to me if you can help\\r\\n\\n\\nit. I am scarcely sane!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Which such has been my opinion for some time past,” said mammy,\\r\\n\\n\\nsententiously, leaving her patient to pace up and down the room until\\r\\n\\n\\nthe latter had paced off some of her excitement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe landlord put his head into the door, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The boy has gone after the carriage, Miss, and you may rely on his\\r\\n\\n\\nbeing back here in an hour’s time.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks. How far do you really think it is from this place to old Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nHall?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why Miss, some people calls it ten miles, but I don’t believe it is\\r\\n\\n\\nmore than eight at the outside.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And how long will it take for me to get there?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Let me see,” said the landlord in his leisurely way. “It’s three\\r\\n\\n\\no’clock now, ain’t it? Yes—well, the boy’ll be back by four, and if you\\r\\n\\n\\nstart then you’ll get there by six or seven. You’ll be there in time to\\r\\n\\n\\ndress for the wedding, Miss, which I hear is to be performed by special\\r\\n\\n\\nlicense at eight o’clock in the evening.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very well. Thank you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And now, Miss, is there anything else we can do for you?” inquired the\\r\\n\\n\\nslow host.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; thanks. Yes! you may send a chamber-maid here,” replied Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nincoherently, for in her intense excitement she scarcely knew what she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas in need of, or what she was talking about.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the host had taken his little round head out of the doorway, mammy,\\r\\n\\n\\nwho had kept silence for some time, said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, ma’am, if so it is that you _will_ go farther and fare worse\\r\\n\\n\\nto-night, and if you have an hour before you I strongly ’vises of you to\\r\\n\\n\\ntake a bedroom and lie down until it is time for you to start, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nto take a cup of tea before you _do_ start. You must keep up your\\r\\n\\n\\nstrength. If the matter you come ’bout is so very important, it won’t do\\r\\n\\n\\nfor you to break down, you know.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla stopped in her excited walk and reflected. The advice of the\\r\\n\\n\\nnurse was very good. There were other reasons besides care for her own\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfort to induce her to engage rooms here. For one thing, she intended\\r\\n\\n\\nto leave her nurse in charge of the luggage, for she was resolved to\\r\\n\\n\\nhave no more witnesses to the humiliation of her poor Alick than was\\r\\n\\n\\nabsolutely unavoidable; and for another thing, she was resolved to stay\\r\\n\\n\\nno longer at the Old Hall than was necessary to do her painful errand\\r\\n\\n\\nthere, but to return as soon as possible to the inn. Therefore, she\\r\\n\\n\\nanswered mammy assentingly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are right, nurse. You generally are so, in fact. Here comes the\\r\\n\\n\\nchamber-maid I sent for, and I will order rooms.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA bright-eyed negro girl stood in the doorway, curtseying and waiting\\r\\n\\n\\norders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn a few words the lady gave them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl went away to obey them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in ten minutes Drusilla found herself in a small, clean, warm room,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere she unloosed her clothes and lay down upon the bed, and, overcome\\r\\n\\n\\nby fatigue and excitement, fell fast asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, thank the Goodness Gracious for that. But who in the world would\\r\\n\\n\\nhave thought it?” said mammy, as she quietly closed the shutters and\\r\\n\\n\\ndarkened the room, and sat down to watch by her patient to try to guard\\r\\n\\n\\nher from disturbance until the carriage should come.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the landlord’s hour stretched to two, and still the carriage did not\\r\\n\\n\\nappear and still the sleeper slept on.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt last, however, mammy heard the sound of wheels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe went to the window, cautiously unclosed the shutters, looked out,\\r\\n\\n\\nand saw the most dilapidated old carryall she had ever set her eyes upon\\r\\n\\n\\napproaching the house.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That’s it! and a purty object it is!” said mammy, as she went and\\r\\n\\n\\nlooked to see what time it was by her mistress’s watch that lay upon the\\r\\n\\n\\ndressing-table. It was a quarter past five.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, dear me!” said the old woman in dismay, “when she finds out how\\r\\n\\n\\nlate it is, and she so anxious to be off, she’ll just go and fling\\r\\n\\n\\nherself into fits, and then there! Let see! I gwine save her all that,\\r\\n\\n\\nand ’ceive her for her own good.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so saying, mammy opened the watch and turned back the hands from a\\r\\n\\n\\nquarter _past five_ to a quarter _to four_.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she stole out of the room and told the waiter to bring a cup of tea\\r\\n\\n\\nand a round of toast upstairs quicker than he ever did anything in his\\r\\n\\n\\nlife before.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she went back to her patient, lamenting that she must wake up out\\r\\n\\n\\nof such a refreshing sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut to her surprise and satisfaction, she found Drusilla already up and\\r\\n\\n\\nstanding before the dressing-table, looking at her watch.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, ma’am, are you awake? I’m so glad you got your sleep out! You _did_\\r\\n\\n\\nget it out, didn’t you, honey? Nobody waked you, did they?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, nurse, I woke because I had slept long enough; and I feel much\\r\\n\\n\\nstrengthened and quite equal to pursue my journey. It is ten minutes to\\r\\n\\n\\nfour. I am so glad I didn’t oversleep myself. I suppose the carriage\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be here soon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The carriage has almost just this minute come, and a purty ramshackly\\r\\n\\n\\nold concern it is too.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Never mind, nurse, so that it will take me to my destination. Come,\\r\\n\\n\\nhelp me to dress quickly. Dear me, what a very dark afternoon,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, going nearer the window for light.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, the clouds do make it very dark indeed,” said mammy,\\r\\n\\n\\nsmiling in her sleeve at the deception she had played off upon her\\r\\n\\n\\nmistress—“but here, ma’am, here comes the waiter with lights and the tea\\r\\n\\n\\ntray,” she added, as she arose and set out a little table.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I have no time to spend in eating and drinking,” said Drusilla, as she\\r\\n\\n\\nhastily put on her bonnet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But you must keep up your strength, ma’am,” urged mammy leading her\\r\\n\\n\\ncharge to the table and making her sit down at it, while she herself\\r\\n\\n\\npoured out a cup of tea and handed it to her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nurse,” said Drusilla, as she received the cup from the old woman, “I\\r\\n\\n\\nshall leave you here in charge of the—_two little red morocco\\r\\n\\n\\ntrunks_—until I return.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My goodness, honey, you will never think of going alone?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I must, nurse. There is no reason why I should not. I feel quite equal\\r\\n\\n\\nto the ride. I am going to see my husband.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, honey, I know if you will do a thing, _you will do it_! When will\\r\\n\\n\\nyou send for me and the luggage, honey?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I may _come_ for you and the luggage even to-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, you mustn’t, indeed! No use for you to do that, nyther. I reckon I\\r\\n\\n\\nain’t afraid to stay alone in a decent inn all night for once in a\\r\\n\\n\\nnight.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Very well, nurse; then you may expect me to come or send for you\\r\\n\\n\\nto-morrow. And now here is my purse—do you pay the landlord and make\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself comfortable. I am going now,” said Drusilla, rising to put on\\r\\n\\n\\nher waterproof cloak.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe nurse helped her on with that and with her overshoes, and then\\r\\n\\n\\naccompanied her down stairs and saw her safely into the old carryall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And here’s your umberel, honey. And you driver boy! when the madam gets\\r\\n\\n\\nout, you be sure to hoist the umberel and hold it over her head to ’vent\\r\\n\\n\\nher getting wet.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All right, ma’am, I won’t forget to do it,” said the lad, cracking his\\r\\n\\n\\nwhip, starting his old horse, and making the dilapidated vehicle rattle\\r\\n\\n\\nand shake, at every turn of the wheels, as if it would drop to pieces.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla sat back in her seat, uncomfortably jolted in the miserable old\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage over that rough road, until, when about a mile from the house,\\r\\n\\n\\nit actually and hopelessly broke down.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen Drusilla was sure of this mishap, she took off her bonnet, drew the\\r\\n\\n\\nhood of her waterproof cloak over her head, and set forth to walk the\\r\\n\\n\\ndistance to Old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOf that heroic effort, and of its successful issue—her safe arrival—the\\r\\n\\n\\nreader is already informed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XLVI.\\r\\n\\n\\n                         THE DESPERATE REMEDY.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n              Let that pass, too. There breathes not one,\\r\\n\\n\\n              Who would not do as I have done.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe bride elect listened to the words of the forsaken wife, first in\\r\\n\\n\\nsurprise and incredulity, then in pity and indignation, and last in a\\r\\n\\n\\nrapture of relief, ineffable and indescribable, and only to be equalled\\r\\n\\n\\nby the ecstacy a condemned criminal must feel when at the last moment\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore execution he receives a full pardon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen all was told, Drusilla sat pale and despairing. Anna flushed and\\r\\n\\n\\nresolute.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not for myself,” said the poor young wife, “not for myself, Heaven\\r\\n\\n\\nknows, and not for you, but for his sake have I done this thing—to save\\r\\n\\n\\nhim from doing, in his madness, a deed that the law might construe into\\r\\n\\n\\na crime and punish with degradation. But oh, Miss Lyon, forgive me if in\\r\\n\\n\\ncoming here I have brought you much sorrow!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush! you have brought me no sorrow, but a great deliverance,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna with a sigh of infinite relief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then you never loved him—as I do!” exclaimed Drusilla, raising her\\r\\n\\n\\nlarge eyes, full of questioning wonder to the face of Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon smiled haughtily, for all reply.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That, at least, is well,” mused the young wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna arose, still flushed and resolute.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Give me that document of which you spoke, my child,” she said,\\r\\n\\n\\nextending her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla drew from her bosom the little black silk bag, took from it the\\r\\n\\n\\npiece of paper in question, and laid it before Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna read it over, with smiling eyes and a curling lip.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Does it prove or disprove my marriage?” anxiously inquired Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I cannot tell, Drusilla; I do not know. But so much is certain—_your_\\r\\n\\n\\nfate, Alick’s, and your unborn child’s, and also my fate and Dick’s—all\\r\\n\\n\\nhang upon this precious little piece of paper, for which I would not\\r\\n\\n\\ntake a mint of money,” said Anna, earnestly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And yet you cannot tell me whether it proves or disproves my marriage.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; for I am not sufficiently learned in the law,” said Anna, moving\\r\\n\\n\\ntowards the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You are going out?” said Drusilla, uneasily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; stay here until I come back, which will be in a few minutes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Miss Lyon! Miss Lyon, do not go to him yet! And do not upbraid him\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen you see him! Your provocation may have been very great, but wait\\r\\n\\n\\nuntil you are cool, and then you will be just,” pleaded the young wife,\\r\\n\\n\\nrising and laying her hands upon the lady’s robes, to stay her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Child, I am not going to him. And I shall _never_ upbraid him,” replied\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, with a superb and beautiful scorn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then you go——?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To my grandfather’s study!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“To denounce him to his uncle? Oh, do not—not yet, not just yet! Wait,\\r\\n\\n\\nwait till you are calm! till you can speak only the words of justice and\\r\\n\\n\\nmercy. Do not denounce him yet!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, I am not going to denounce him now or ever. Wait _you_, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsee what I shall do!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What, what?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall save the miserable sinner, if he is to be saved at all!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But, how? oh, how?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Wait _you_, and trust me!” answered Anna, flashing out of the room and\\r\\n\\n\\ntaking the mysterious little document with her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe walked—no, in the exhilaration of her spirits, she almost danced\\r\\n\\n\\ndown the hall, towards her grandfather’s little study, over the great\\r\\n\\n\\nentrance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs she tripped on she noticed the chamber-doors on each side wide open,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the fire light within shining down on the polished dark oak floors.\\r\\n\\n\\nIn many of the rooms, the chamber-maids were putting on fresh logs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think you need not take that trouble. I fancy there will be no\\r\\n\\n\\nwedding guests here to-night,” said Anna, smiling, as she passed them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Richard has come, Miss,” replied one of the women.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” exclaimed Anna, stopping short with a beating heart. A few seconds\\r\\n\\n\\nshe paused to recover composure, and then she rushed on.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, my darling! have you come to show yourself to me in all your\\r\\n\\n\\nbridal glory, before you go down to be married? Ah! truly, you look very\\r\\n\\n\\nbeautiful, my Anna. May Heaven make your spirit even more beautiful than\\r\\n\\n\\nits outward form,” said the fine old soldier, reaching out his hand to\\r\\n\\n\\nhis grand-daughter, as she entered his room, and drawing her towards\\r\\n\\n\\nhim.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am very glad that you are pleased with me, grandfather,” she said, as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe seated herself on his knee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You look happier now, my Anna, than you did half an hour ago.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I feel happier, dear sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And what makes the difference?” he smiled.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘A change has come over the spirit of my dream;’ that is all,” laughed\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, my dear! feminine caprice, but I am glad of it. Well, you are\\r\\n\\n\\nready, Alick is ready, I am ready, and Dick is here; but we have no\\r\\n\\n\\nbridesmaid and no minister.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, grandpa, we have a bridesmaid!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! I am glad of that! Which of the six young ladies is it who has\\r\\n\\n\\nbraved the storm for love of you?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Annie,” answered Miss Lyon, evasively, meaning our Anna Drusilla, but\\r\\n\\n\\nwishing her grandpa to understand another Anna, as he did, for he\\r\\n\\n\\nimmediately exclaimed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah! little Annie Seymour! Well she lived nearest! and she must answer\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the whole six. But my dear, the carriage has not yet returned with\\r\\n\\n\\nthe minister.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The way is long and the roads are very bad. Doubtless he will come; but\\r\\n\\n\\nit may be late. Was there a special license got out for us, dear\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandpa?” inquired Anna, speaking with assumed carelessness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, of course, there was, my dear!” answered the old soldier,\\r\\n\\n\\nelevating his eyebrows in astonishment, at the question.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who got it?” dear grandpa.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, Alick, to be sure! who else?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Who has it now, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Bless my soul, what an inquisitive little puss. What is it to you who\\r\\n\\n\\nhas it? Are you afraid it is not all right? Would you like to inspect it\\r\\n\\n\\nfor yourself?” laughed the general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please; yes, sir, I should,” answered Anna, archly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Lest there should be any informality in it, eh?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Such things have happened, sir; but it is not the fear of that which\\r\\n\\n\\nprompts me; for I have always had a curiosity to look at a special\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage license; so if Alick has it, please get it from him, that I may\\r\\n\\n\\ngratify this wish. I only want it for a few minutes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, of all the whims of whimsical women, yours is certainly the most\\r\\n\\n\\nabsurd!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will you get the license away from Alick, and let me look at it\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandpa?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You persist in this?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, fortunately, I have not got to go to Alick with such a ridiculous\\r\\n\\n\\nrequest as the loan of a license. I have it here with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes. You see Alick, thinking from the state of the weather, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nlooks of things generally, that he should have no groomsman for the\\r\\n\\n\\nceremony, put his marriage license and the minister’s fee both in one\\r\\n\\n\\nenvelope, and requested me, when the proper time should come, to hand it\\r\\n\\n\\nover to Dr. Barbar. But, now I hear that Dick has arrived—having so far\\r\\n\\n\\nconquered himself as to come to the wedding. I mean to conscript him\\r\\n\\n\\ninto the service, arm him with this paper, and make him do duty as\\r\\n\\n\\ngroomsman.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Where is the packet, dear grandpa?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Here, my dear, since you must needs see the license (which the\\r\\n\\n\\nofficiating clergyman scarcely ever does, as he takes its contents for\\r\\n\\n\\ngranted), you may read it at your leisure, while I go down stairs and\\r\\n\\n\\ninquire if my messenger has returned from the parsonage,” said General\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon, as he handed a white embossed envelope to the bride elect, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthen left the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe sank down into an easy chair and opened the envelope, which of\\r\\n\\n\\ncourse was not sealed. She took out the marriage license, in which she\\r\\n\\n\\nfound folded a five hundred dollar bank note.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith a curling lip and flashing eyes she read over the form of license,\\r\\n\\n\\nand then, with a smile of scorn and triumph, she put it on the glowing\\r\\n\\n\\nfire and watched it blaze up and burn to ashes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she took that mysterious little document given her by Drusilla,\\r\\n\\n\\nwrapped it around the big bank note and put both in the envelope and\\r\\n\\n\\nfolded it neatly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Alexander Lyon, whoever you may marry to-night, you will\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainty not marry me!” she mused, maliciously, as she sat and waited\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her grandfather’s return. Presently she heard footsteps coming up\\r\\n\\n\\nthe corridor; but they were not those of the old General.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe arose to her feet and her heart stood still.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick Hammond entered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anna! You here? Pardon me, I expected only to find my uncle,” he\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed, in a voice vibrating with emotion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick! dear Dick! you are welcome! Shake hands, Dick. No, take it! it is\\r\\n\\n\\na free hand now. I know all, Dick!” exclaimed Anna trembling with excess\\r\\n\\n\\nof agitation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe clasped her hand and carried it to his lips.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I came here to tell your grandfather everything and to prove all that I\\r\\n\\n\\nshould tell. But I have been anticipated.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Drusilla is here.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I knew she was on her way. I came a night’s journey with her in the\\r\\n\\n\\ncoach. But I saw that she tried to escape recognition by me; for what\\r\\n\\n\\nreason I could not guess; so, not to trouble her with my presence, in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe morning I got off the coach and took another route. I feared that\\r\\n\\n\\nshe would not be able to continue her journey.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She arrived this evening,” said Anna, calmly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And she has told you all?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And _what_ does your grandfather think of this?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He does not know it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How? not know it?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Dick. Drusilla told me only. I have not told my grandfather, nor do\\r\\n\\n\\nI intend to do so.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then I myself I will denounce the scoundrel to my uncle,” exclaimed\\r\\n\\n\\nHammond, shaking with passion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, Dick, we will not denounce him. We will do a deal better than that.\\r\\n\\n\\nListen, Dick: My dear old grandpa says he intends to conscript you into\\r\\n\\n\\nthe service to do duty as groomsman.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He does!” exclaimed Hammond, with his eyes flashing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, and, Dick, you must consent.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Consent! _I_ consent! Anna, do you mean this iniquitous marriage to go\\r\\n\\n\\non?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I do. And Dick, you must be groomsman and hand the license and the\\r\\n\\n\\nfee both over to the minister. See, here they are in this pretty\\r\\n\\n\\nenvelope. Grandpa got it ready for you. So, Dick, you must do it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If I do, may I he eternally consigned to the deepest pit in—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n—“Hush, Dick, and don’t go off at a tangent. Look me in the face, sir!\\r\\n\\n\\nright in the eyes!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anna, what do you mean?” he inquired, meeting her steady gaze.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do you see anything ‘iniquitous’ in my countenance?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No; but I see a mystery there.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“A holy mystery, as I suppose a ‘pious fraud’ may be called. Now, sir,\\r\\n\\n\\nwill you open this envelope, which is to be entrusted to you, to be\\r\\n\\n\\ndelivered to the minister, and examine its contents?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why,” said Dick in perplexity, as he looked at the enclosure, “this\\r\\n\\n\\nis—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it _is_. I have taken advantage of my grandpa’s absence to burn my\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage license and substitute this one. And _you_ must hand it\\r\\n\\n\\nenclosed in the envelope, with the fee, to the minister, when we stand\\r\\n\\n\\nup to be married. And _now_, Dick, do you begin to see daylight?”\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I think I do. Yet I do not quite comprehend yet. You mean—”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Here comes my grandfather, and we have not a minute more for\\r\\n\\n\\nexplanation. Play the part assigned to you—blindly, if you must—and\\r\\n\\n\\ntrust me with the issue. Will you, Dick?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I WILL, Anna.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And Dick, here, listen quick!—Just before I am to be sent for, go down\\r\\n\\n\\ninto the great drawing-room and put out two thirds of the wax candles. I\\r\\n\\n\\nwant a subdued light, not an illumination there. Will you remember,\\r\\n\\n\\nDick, and do it yourself, so as to insure its being done?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Anna, I will; and now I _do_ begin to understand you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush, here he is!” whispered Miss Lyon, as her grandfather came to the\\r\\n\\n\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Dick, my dear boy! how are you? so glad to see you!” exclaimed old\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon, entering and holding out his hand to Richard Hammond, who\\r\\n\\n\\ntook and pressed it affectionately.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So very glad to see you here, Dick! Your very first visit to Old Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nHall! And now I shall expect you to stay and comfort me when my young\\r\\n\\n\\npeople are gone.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall be very happy to do so, sir,” answered Dick, sincerely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But how the deuce did you find your way here, through this wilderness\\r\\n\\n\\nof a country, and over these dreadful roads?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I inquired of your protegées, the old Scotch emigrants, at the\\r\\n\\n\\nturnpike gate,” answered Dick, laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Old Andy and Jenny. Ay, poor souls! Well, Dick, you are here in a good\\r\\n\\n\\nhour. All our guests have failed us—groomsmen, and bridesmaids, and all,\\r\\n\\n\\nexcept little Annie Seymour. And so you must play groomsman, and lead\\r\\n\\n\\nAnnie down.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall be very happy to do so, sir, if Alick desires it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, he does. I heard that you were here, and so I looked in at\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick’s room and mentioned the matter to him. And he declared that he\\r\\n\\n\\nwould be very much obliged if you would do him so much honor. So, you\\r\\n\\n\\nwill see it is all right.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And here, Dick, is the license and the fee, both in this envelope,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich it will be your duty as groomsman to hand to the officiating\\r\\n\\n\\nminister.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And, by the way, I hear wheels, and his carriage must be coming,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old gentleman, leaving the study to inquire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, the bride elect had returned to her own room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla still sat there in the easy chair, with her hands clasped upon\\r\\n\\n\\nher lap and her head bowed upon her breast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna went and took a seat beside her, and said, with earnestness almost\\r\\n\\n\\namounting to solemnity:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, if you wish to save Alick from guilt and remorse, and\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself and your child from wrong and shame, you must place your\\r\\n\\n\\ndestiny in my hands to-night, and do as I direct you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe helpless young wife looked up in the lady’s face, and murmured\\r\\n\\n\\nmournfully:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is a great trust you seek, Miss Lyon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It _is_, Drusilla, a very great trust; yet I seek it. It is also for\\r\\n\\n\\nyou a very great trial, yet I ask you to meet it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I would meet anything for Alick’s sake, Miss Lyon, if I may save him,\\r\\n\\n\\nas you say. Please to explain yourself, Miss Lyon,” she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, you know that Alexander Lyon is waiting and expecting to\\r\\n\\n\\nmarry me to-night,” said the bride elect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” moaned the wronged wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And my grandfather and his household are equally waiting and expecting\\r\\n\\n\\nto witness a wedding.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, they must not any of them be disappointed.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, what do you mean?” inquired Drusilla, with an anxious sigh.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not to marry Alick myself, you may rest assured,” answered Anna,\\r\\n\\n\\ndisdainfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, no, for you could not do that.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Of course not, as I consider him already married. You are his wife, in\\r\\n\\n\\nright, if not in law, Drusilla,” said Miss Lyon, emphatically.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I _know_ I am so by right, and I _believe_ I am so by law,” answered\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla solemnly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yet those who know more of law than we do differ from us. And this\\r\\n\\n\\nmakes your position, Drusilla, very doubtful, very unsafe, and deeply\\r\\n\\n\\nhumiliating.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know it, I feel it, through all my darkened spirit and in every pulse\\r\\n\\n\\nof my breaking heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“This state of affairs should not be permitted to exist for a moment,\\r\\n\\n\\nespecially—oh, most especially—as you are so soon to be a mother. No\\r\\n\\n\\nquestion of the lawfulness of your union with Alexander Lyon should be\\r\\n\\n\\npermitted to arise.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, no, no!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But how to silence such questions forever, how to legalize your union\\r\\n\\n\\nand legitimatize your child—there is the difficulty.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla moaned, but spoke no word in answer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If I were to go now to Alick and tell him of your presence in the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse, and urge him to resign my hand and to do you justice, he would\\r\\n\\n\\nnot hear me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, he would not,” wailed Drusilla.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If I were to appeal to my grandfather, the high-spirited old soldier\\r\\n\\n\\nwould—kick him out doors!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” gasped Drusilla, pierced more sharply by this idea of prospective\\r\\n\\n\\ninsult to her Alick than she could be by any ignomy that might cover\\r\\n\\n\\nherself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then what is to be done?” inquired Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Nothing, nothing,” sighed Drusilla. “I wish I were dead. I wish I were\\r\\n\\n\\nin Heaven!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; but you see we can’t die just when the whim seizes us; and if we\\r\\n\\n\\ncould, we shouldn’t go to Heaven by _that_ means.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Heaven have mercy! have mercy on me, for my state is desperate!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Drusilla, your state _is_ desperate—desperate enough to drive you\\r\\n\\n\\nto despair.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Despair! I have lived in it for months. I shall die in it!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you do you will never see Heaven at all. For despair is the last and\\r\\n\\n\\nmost fatal of sins. But you needn’t give up to it just yet!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, what do you mean? What hope have I in this world?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“The hope that lasts as long as life. Listen, Drusilla. I said that your\\r\\n\\n\\nstate was desperate—not that your cause was lost. ‘Desperate cases\\r\\n\\n\\nrequire desperate remedies.’ Your case is such a one, and my remedy is\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch a one.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What remedy have you for me? However desperate, however dangerous, I\\r\\n\\n\\nwill not refuse it or shrink from it! I would dare anything, suffer\\r\\n\\n\\nanything, to save my Alick from his sin and win him back to me again!”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid the devoted wife, clasping her hands and gazing imploringly into\\r\\n\\n\\nthe eyes of the lady who seemed now to hold her destiny.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then attend to me, Drusilla, while I divulge my plan—the _only_ plan by\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich you can save your Alick from present guilt and future remorse, and\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself and your child from the greatest wrong and the deepest\\r\\n\\n\\nshame—the only plan, Drusilla, by which you may hope to WIN YOUR WAY!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Speak on, tell me! I listen!” gasped Drusilla, in a breathless voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, as I said before, Alexander Lyon is confidently hoping to lead\\r\\n\\n\\nhis bride before the minister this evening. His hopes must be\\r\\n\\n\\nfulfilled—in you, Drusilla!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In me!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, in you! You must enact the bride this evening.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In the name of Heaven, what is this that you are proposing to me?”\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed Drusilla, gazing in wonder at Miss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That you shall take my place in this evening’s solemn farce and be fast\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried to your husband, if you never were before,” said Anna, calmly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Impossible, Miss Lyon! He would reject me at first sight, and I!—I\\r\\n\\n\\nshould die of mortification!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, if he should be permitted to recognize you, he might reject you.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut he is not to be favored with a sight of your face until he is\\r\\n\\n\\nirrecoverably bound to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Even then he would renounce me—renounce me with maledictions.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, let him! I should thank him for freeing me, if I were you. Why\\r\\n\\n\\nshould you care, so that his great wrong to you and to his child is\\r\\n\\n\\nrighted—so that your good name is redeemed from unmerited reproach, and\\r\\n\\n\\nyour innocent child from undeserved shame? After you are fast\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried—let him go, if he will, say I!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Miss Lyon! Miss Lyon! I never deceived any one in all my life!\\r\\n\\n\\nShall I begin by deceiving my dear Alick?” she said, wringing her poor\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle hands again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla, this will be no deception, but a pious fraud—if ever there\\r\\n\\n\\nwas such a thing in the world!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Miss Lyon, you mean well; but I could not practise this ‘pious\\r\\n\\n\\nfraud’ upon any one, least of all upon my dear Alick! I could not, Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon, I could not!” fervently exclaimed the loyal young creature,\\r\\n\\n\\ntightly clasping her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then you accept the dishonor to which he has doomed you, rather than\\r\\n\\n\\nclear your fame in the manner I propose?” said Anna, curling her lovely\\r\\n\\n\\nlip.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes Miss Lyon, yes; rather than force myself in this way upon my dear\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick, if I have really no right to his name, I will accept the\\r\\n\\n\\nundeserved shame,” said Drusilla, sadly but firmly, while the devotion\\r\\n\\n\\nof a young martyr glowed through her beautiful pale face.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna nodded her head two or three times, and then said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So be it. You may have the right to immolate yourself upon this\\r\\n\\n\\nidolatrous altar of your inordinate affections. But who I pray you,\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung mother, who gave you the right to doom your innocent unborn child,\\r\\n\\n\\nyour poor little helpless child, to the deep degradation of\\r\\n\\n\\nillegitimacy?” demanded Miss Lyon, solemnly fixing her eyes upon the\\r\\n\\n\\nface of Drusilla, and seeing her mouth tremble and the big tears roll,\\r\\n\\n\\nbead-like, down her cheeks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush! oh, in pity, hush, Miss Lyon! Do not speak of this!” she pleaded.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But I must and will speak of it!” persisted Anna, who now discovered\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she had touched a chord in Drusilla’s heart, through which she\\r\\n\\n\\nmight draw her into the proposed plan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd though the poor, wronged girl wept and wrung her hands, Miss Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\npersevered in pleading this cause, mercilessly setting before the young\\r\\n\\n\\nmother the shames and woes that must attend her child through life,\\r\\n\\n\\nshould she persist in her present resolution.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOf course, Anna gained her point.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“For the poor baby’s sake, I consent. Do with me as you will,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla, weeping bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is right. Come now and let me dress you. We have taken up too much\\r\\n\\n\\ntime in talking. We have very little left. I expect every moment to hear\\r\\n\\n\\nthat the minister has arrived,” said Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she flew to the chamber door, and turned the key.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd she quickly took off her bridal robes, and carefully dressed\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla in them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she placed the wreath of orange blossoms on her head, and laid the\\r\\n\\n\\nveil of white lace over all.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There,” said Anna, giving her a pair of white kid-gloves, “put these on\\r\\n\\n\\nwhile I dress as a bridesmaid—for while you personate Miss Lyon, I must\\r\\n\\n\\nseem to be Miss Seymour.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJust at that moment, some one rapped softly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna flew to answer the summons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, what is wanted now?” she inquired, without opening the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, Miss, the Reverend Dr. Barbar have come, and Mr. Alick\\r\\n\\n\\nand Mr. Dick is both waitin’; and Master’s compliments, and is you and\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Annie ready to come down?” spoke the voice of Marcy from without.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, we are not quite ready yet, but we soon shall be. Miss Annie is\\r\\n\\n\\ndressing. Ask them to come for us in about fifteen minutes,” said Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe then hurried to her wardrobes and bureaus, selected from her large\\r\\n\\n\\noutfit of clothing a white taffeta-silk dress, and a large white tulle\\r\\n\\n\\nveil, and quickly and carefully disguised herself in them. So much\\r\\n\\n\\ndispatch did she use that she, as well as Drusilla, was ready and\\r\\n\\n\\nwaiting full five minutes before the summons came for them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Courage now, my dear child! Remember how much is at stake, how much\\r\\n\\n\\ndepends upon your self-possession. Draw your veil closely over your\\r\\n\\n\\nface. I will do the same with mine. They will ascribe this to our\\r\\n\\n\\nbashfulness. You must take Alick’s arm, I shall take Dick’s. Never mind\\r\\n\\n\\nif your hands tremble or your tongue falters—it will seem natural. Come\\r\\n\\n\\nnow!” whispered Anna to her agitated companion, as she led her to the\\r\\n\\n\\nchamber door and opened it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick and Dick stood outside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My adored Anna, this is the happiest moment of my existence!” gallantly\\r\\n\\n\\nwhispered Alick, as he took the half-offered hand of Drusilla, pressed\\r\\n\\n\\nit fervently to his lips, and drew it within his arm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe bowed in silence. It seemed all that was expected of a bride under\\r\\n\\n\\nthe circumstances.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Miss Seymour, I believe? Yes? Well, I am very glad to meet you again,\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Annie, especially on this auspicious occasion,” said Dick, bending\\r\\n\\n\\nlow over the hand of Anna, and then drawing it within his own and\\r\\n\\n\\nleading her after the bride and bridegroom who were walking before.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick,” whispered Anna, “are we both well disguised?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Excellently,” returned Mr. Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Did you partially darken the room by putting out two thirds of the\\r\\n\\n\\nlights?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I nearly quite darkened it by putting out three quarters of them. I had\\r\\n\\n\\na good opportunity of doing it, being alone in the drawing-room while\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick and the parson were closeted with the governor. He—the governor I\\r\\n\\n\\nmean—swore a few at the servants when he came down by himself to see\\r\\n\\n\\nthat all was right. But the servants all declared ignorance of the cause\\r\\n\\n\\nof the lights going out, and as it was too late to remedy the evil he\\r\\n\\n\\ndid not attempt it.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Thanks, Dick. And now you understand my purpose; have you confidence in\\r\\n\\n\\nme?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In your sincerity, _yes_: but in your success, _no_. I tremble for you,\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, lest when all is done you should find yourself fast married to\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick. I do, indeed, Anna!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How foolish of you, Dick. Why, I burned the license.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I know you did, Anna; but—I wish you would keep as far as possible from\\r\\n\\n\\nthe side of Alick Lyon when he stands before a minister who holds a\\r\\n\\n\\nprayer-book in his hands open at the marriage service!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Be at ease, Dick, I shall place Alick’s wife between me and him. I\\r\\n\\n\\nshall consider her an insurmountable obstacle.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush, Anna, we must not talk more! we are too near them,” whispered\\r\\n\\n\\nDick, in a very low tone as they came up very close behind the foremost\\r\\n\\n\\ncouple.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd what were Drusilla’s feelings when she found herself again by her\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick’s side, her hand drawn closely within his protecting arm, and\\r\\n\\n\\npressed frequently against his beating heart—knowing, as she did, that\\r\\n\\n\\nhe was then meditating against her the deepest wrong man could inflict\\r\\n\\n\\nupon woman—feeling, as she did, that every caress bestowed upon her, in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis ignorance of her identity, was intended for another; and going, as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was, to take from him, by a holy stratagem, those sacred rights of\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich he had so cruelly deprived her; and to brave and bear his terrible\\r\\n\\n\\nanger when that stratagem should be discovered, as it must be when the\\r\\n\\n\\nrites should be over—what were her feelings?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nA great medical philosopher has written that “Nature is before art with\\r\\n\\n\\nher anesthetics.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Drusilla’s present state was an illustration of this. In the supreme\\r\\n\\n\\ncrisis of her fate she scarcely realized her position. She was like one\\r\\n\\n\\npartially overcome by ether or chloroform; her head was ringing, her\\r\\n\\n\\nsenses whirling, her reason tottering; she went on as a somnambulist,\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf conscious of her state, but unable to awake. It may be doubtful\\r\\n\\n\\nwhether she would now have retreated if she could; but it is quite\\r\\n\\n\\ncertain that she _could not_ have done so even if she would. She was\\r\\n\\n\\nunder a potent spell that hurried her forward with all the irresistible\\r\\n\\n\\nforce of destiny.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe drawing-room doors were thrown open. The little bridal procession\\r\\n\\n\\npassed in.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe room, thanks to Dick, was very dimly lighted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUpon the rug, with his back to the fire, and facing the advancing party,\\r\\n\\n\\nstood the officiating clergyman in his surplice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNear him was the grand and martial figure of the veteran soldier,\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt a respectful distance stood a group of the old family servants.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe bridal party come on and formed before the minister—Alexander and\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla stood together in the center; on Alexander’s right stood\\r\\n\\n\\nRichard, on Drusilla’s left stood Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAll were reverently silent.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt a signal from General Lyon; Richard Hammond put the envelope supposed\\r\\n\\n\\nto contain the license and the fee into the hands of the minister, who\\r\\n\\n\\nmerely, as a matter of form, glanced over it and then opened his book\\r\\n\\n\\nand began the sacred rite by reading the solemn exhortation with which\\r\\n\\n\\nthey commence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old, loving servants, who had hitherto kept at a reverential\\r\\n\\n\\ndistance from their masters, now drew as near the scene of action as\\r\\n\\n\\nthey dared do, so that they might hear every syllable of the ceremony\\r\\n\\n\\nthat was to unite, as they supposed, their young mistress to the husband\\r\\n\\n\\nof her choice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen the minister, in the course of his reading, came to these awful\\r\\n\\n\\nwords—awful at least, to one of the contracting parties, he delivered\\r\\n\\n\\nthem with great effect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘If any man can show just cause, why these may not be joined together,\\r\\n\\n\\nlet him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe minister made the usual formal pause, for the answer that might\\r\\n\\n\\noften come, but never does; and then, with the most solemn emphasis, he\\r\\n\\n\\naddressed the pair before him:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘I require and charge _you_, BOTH, as ye will answer at the dreadful\\r\\n\\n\\nday of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that\\r\\n\\n\\nif either of _you_ know any impediment, why you may not be lawfully\\r\\n\\n\\njoined together in matrimony ye do now confess it. For be ye well\\r\\n\\n\\nassured, that if any persons are joined together, otherwise than God’s\\r\\n\\n\\nWord doth allow, their marriage is not lawful.’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs the minister read this dread adjuration, the face of the bridegroom\\r\\n\\n\\nwas observed to flush and pale, and his form to tremble and shake as\\r\\n\\n\\nwith a sudden ague fit.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut though the minister made the customary pause, no one spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the ceremony proceeded.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Alexander, wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife?’” et\\r\\n\\n\\ncetera.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the bridegroom answered in a firm and almost defiant voice:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘I WILL.’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe clergyman continued:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Anna, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband?’” and so\\r\\n\\n\\nforth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the bride, Anna Drusilla, faltered in whispering tones:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘_I will._’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?’” was the next\\r\\n\\n\\nquestion in the ritual.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘I do,’” answered the sonorous voice of old General Lyon, as he came\\r\\n\\n\\nforward, took the hand of the bride and placed it in that of the\\r\\n\\n\\nminister.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen the brave old soldier stepped back and turned away his head, to\\r\\n\\n\\nhide the tears that filled those eyes which had never quailed in the\\r\\n\\n\\nbattle’s deadliest brawl; though they wept now, at his giving away, as\\r\\n\\n\\nhe supposed the last darling of his old age.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the minister was now joining the hands of the pair before him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd bridegroom and bride, in their turn plighted their troth each to the\\r\\n\\n\\nother.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlick uttered his vows in the firm and rather defiant tones in which he\\r\\n\\n\\nhad made all his responses.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna Drusilla breathed hers in murmurs low as the softest notes of the\\r\\n\\n\\nÆolian harp.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen the ring was given and received.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe last prayers were said; the benediction was given, and the pair was\\r\\n\\n\\npronounced to be man and wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander turned gaily and gallantly to salute his bride.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon, as bridesmaid, lifted the veil.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd the faithless husband stood face to face with the forsaken wife!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“‘DRUSILLA!!’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe uttered but that one word, and reeled backward, white and ghastly, as\\r\\n\\n\\nif stricken by death.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla stood pale and mute her head sunk upon her bosom, her hands\\r\\n\\n\\nhanging by her side.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe parson, in his panic, dropped his prayer-book, and stood gazing in\\r\\n\\n\\nconsternation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon bent forward in astonishment and perplexity.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick was looking on in amusement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Anna smiling in triumph.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XLVII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                               EXPOSURE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n              Away! upon this earth beneath\\r\\n\\n\\n              There is no spot where thou and I\\r\\n\\n\\n              Together, for an hour could breathe.—BYRON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon was the first to break the ominous silence. Turning to the\\r\\n\\n\\nbridegroom, he sternly demanded:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir! what is the meaning of this?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ask your beautiful grand-daughter, sir, who, doubtless, to serve her\\r\\n\\n\\nown pleasure, has lent herself to the basest fraud ever practised upon a\\r\\n\\n\\nman,” answered Alexander, now livid with suppressed rage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old gentleman looked gravely upon the laughing face of Anna, and\\r\\n\\n\\ninquired, sadly:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What is this that you have done, my child?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon hesitated and looked confused.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Pray, my dear sir,” said Dick Hammond, taking advantage of the pause\\r\\n\\n\\nand advancing to her rescue, “let _me_ explain this humiliating affair.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So _you_ were in it, were you?” fiercely exclaimed Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nconfronting Richard. “All right! here is _one_, at least whom I can and\\r\\n\\n\\nwill call to a severe account.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I am quite ready,” coolly replied Dick, “to admit and answer for my\\r\\n\\n\\nshare in this matter!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick! hold your tongue! How dare you, sir? This is _my_ thunder! And if\\r\\n\\n\\nyou open your mouth again without leave, I’ll—discard you forever! Stand\\r\\n\\n\\nback, sir!” exclaimed Anna, with her blue eyes blazing upon the\\r\\n\\n\\noffender.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe retreated as from before a fire, and stood laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“My dear grandfather,” said Anna, turning towards the veteran soldier,\\r\\n\\n\\n“this is solely _my_ affair. May I speak without interruption?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Lyon,” answered the old gentleman, with grave dignity, “I\\r\\n\\n\\nwait to hear.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, sir, in a very few words, I will resolve the whole mystery. You\\r\\n\\n\\nmust know that at the time Mr. Alexander Lyon sought the hand of your\\r\\n\\n\\ngrand-daughter, he had already a living wife, or one who believed\\r\\n\\n\\nherself to be so!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is false!” burst forth from Alexander’s livid lips—“as false as——!\\r\\n\\n\\nMy cousin has been deceived!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is as true as truth! I will prove it to be so!” put in Richard\\r\\n\\n\\nHammond.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick! what did I tell you? If you speak again, I will have you turned\\r\\n\\n\\nout!” exclaimed Anna, who was most anxious to prevent a collision\\r\\n\\n\\nbetween the two young men.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He had a wife living and sought your hand?” exclaimed the gallant old\\r\\n\\n\\nsoldier, slowly turning his eyes from Anna to Alick, and back again. “My\\r\\n\\n\\nchild, you must mistake. Such were the act of a scoundrel, and none such\\r\\n\\n\\never bore the name of Lyon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir!” cried Alexander, in a voice thrilled and a countenance agonized\\r\\n\\n\\nby shame—“Sir, hear me, hear one word of my defence before you utterly\\r\\n\\n\\ncondemn me! I do not any more than yourself, understand this strange\\r\\n\\n\\nscene, which seems to have been got up as a very bad joke against me.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut—that my name _is_ Lyon should be an all-sufficient guarantee that I\\r\\n\\n\\nam no scoundrel, and quite incapable of seeking to wed one woman while\\r\\n\\n\\nlegally bound to another.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That is a denial, not a defence,” coldly replied General Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, sir,” said Alexander, withdrawing a few paces from the group and\\r\\n\\n\\nsignaling to General Lyon to follow him—“I have to confess to somewhat\\r\\n\\n\\nof human frailty in order to exculpate myself from the charge of crime.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Go on, sir,” curtly commanded the old gentleman, who had come to his\\r\\n\\n\\nside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPoor Drusilla had lifted her head, which had rested upon the bosom of\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, and bent slightly forward to hear her fate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will you proceed, sir?” sternly inquired the General, seeing that his\\r\\n\\n\\nnephew hesitated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is an unpleasant story to tell. But lest you should have cause to\\r\\n\\n\\nthink worse of me than I deserve, I must admit that the young person\\r\\n\\n\\nhere present was my companion for a few months of youthful\\r\\n\\n\\nhallucination; but there was no marriage.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Oh, Alick! Alick! Oh! Alick! my Alick!_” impulsively burst from the\\r\\n\\n\\npale lips of Drusilla with a low, long drawn wail of sorrow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Anna once more put her arms around the feeble form, and drew the\\r\\n\\n\\nbowed head down upon her supporting bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir, what then?” severely demanded the General.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I must admit,” said Alexander, with a flushed brow, and with some\\r\\n\\n\\ncompunction awakened by the voice of her whom he had once loved, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwith much shame at having to make the confession—“I must admit that,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough there really was none, yet the poor girl supposed there was a\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage, since there was a semblance of one.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“What, sir!” thundered the grand old soldier, “deceive a maiden with the\\r\\n\\n\\n‘semblance’ of a marriage and call yourself a Lyon?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Again you mistake me, sir!” cried Alexander, a hot blush rushing over\\r\\n\\n\\nhis face. “I also believed at the time it was performed that the\\r\\n\\n\\nceremony which united us was a legal one. I continued to believe so,\\r\\n\\n\\neven after the hallucination which led to the false and fatal step had\\r\\n\\n\\npassed away—continued to believe so until last March, when I chanced to\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscover that by the accidental omission of an important form my\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage with this girl was illegal.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And of course, sir, having discovered such an error, you took the\\r\\n\\n\\nearliest opportunity of rectifying it and making your marriage legal?”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid General Lyon, emphatically.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, sir! have I not told you that the illusion which lured me to the\\r\\n\\n\\nfolly of such a misalliance was past and gone? No, sir, I was too happy\\r\\n\\n\\nto be free to retrieve my errors, and to come back, as in duty bound, to\\r\\n\\n\\nmy first love and first faith,” said Alexander, turning and bowing\\r\\n\\n\\ndeeply to Anna, who drew herself proudly erect and bent upon him a look\\r\\n\\n\\nof ineffable contempt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“_Oh, Alick, my Alick!_” breathed Drusilla, in an almost expiring voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hush, dear child, hush! Don’t you see and hear that he is utterly\\r\\n\\n\\nbeneath your love and regret?” whispered Miss Lyon, tenderly drawing the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung bowed head upon her shoulder and pressing the poor broken heart to\\r\\n\\n\\nher bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Proceed, sir!” said General Lyon, scowling darkly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“There is little more to say but this,” muttered Alexander, in an\\r\\n\\n\\nintensely mortified and irritated tone. “From the moment in which I\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovered the illegality of my union with this girl, of course I broke\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her—not harshly, but very gently. From that moment I treated her\\r\\n\\n\\nonly as a sister, and visited her with less and less frequency until I\\r\\n\\n\\nceased altogether. Until this hour, I assure you, my dear sir, I had not\\r\\n\\n\\nseen this girl for months, in fact not since April last. I meant never\\r\\n\\n\\nto see her again, but I took measures to provide handsomely for her\\r\\n\\n\\nfuture support. Such, my dear uncle, is the ‘head and front of my\\r\\n\\n\\noffending’—a boyish error, heedlessly fallen into, deeply repented of\\r\\n\\n\\nand eagerly atoned for. It is seldom that a young man’s follies are so\\r\\n\\n\\ncruelly exposed as mine have been this evening,” added Alexander, with\\r\\n\\n\\nan injured air.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And this is your explanation?” haughtily demanded the General.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is. For the girl’s sake I would willingly have concealed the\\r\\n\\n\\ncircumstance; but in the present state of affairs I deemed the\\r\\n\\n\\nexplanation due to yourself as well as to my lovely cousin,” replied\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, again turning with a bow to Anna, who again flashed back upon\\r\\n\\n\\nhim a look of fiery scorn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But how comes this unhappy young woman here, sir?” severely inquired\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I beg to refer that question to the young woman herself, or to her two\\r\\n\\n\\nconfederates, Miss Lyon and Mr. Hammond,” replied Alexander, making a\\r\\n\\n\\nsweeping bow that included the whole circle, and then stepping back.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How came this hapless young creature here, Anna?” questioned the old\\r\\n\\n\\nman, turning to his grand-daughter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Permit me, if you please, to answer,” said Richard Hammond, coming\\r\\n\\n\\nforward.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick! be silent! If you speak again till I bid you, I will never speak\\r\\n\\n\\nto _you_ again! This is _my_ thunder, I tell you, and you have nothing\\r\\n\\n\\nto do with it. Grandpa, order him to be still!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Be quiet, Richard. Proceed, Anna!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then listen, sir. You must know that this poor child, living alone in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe isolated country house where her husband had immured her, suspected\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing of his wicked addresses to me until the day before yesterday,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen suddenly she received authentic information—no matter from whom——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It was from——” began Richard.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hold you tongue, Dick! She received authentic information, I say, of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis intended marriage with me. Believing herself as I believe her to be,\\r\\n\\n\\nhis wife in law, as she is in right, and wishing to save him from the\\r\\n\\n\\nsin he meditated and the punishment she feared would be its consequence,\\r\\n\\n\\nwilling also to save me from the precipice of ruin upon which I\\r\\n\\n\\nunconsciously stood, this young fragile creature, notwithstanding her\\r\\n\\n\\ndelicate health and broken heart, all unfit as she was to travel, came\\r\\n\\n\\nby stage-coach the whole distance from Washington to Saulsburg, and\\r\\n\\n\\nfinding no conveyance there, walked all the way through this dreadful\\r\\n\\n\\nweather on this dark night, over the worst roads in the country, from\\r\\n\\n\\nSaulsburg to this house. She came to me in my chamber, privately told me\\r\\n\\n\\nher story, shielding her faithless husband as much as she could; and she\\r\\n\\n\\nbesought me to withdraw from the marriage, and save him from guilt and\\r\\n\\n\\nmyself from fatal wrong.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then why has she attempted to force herself upon me in this shameless\\r\\n\\n\\nmanner? And why have you aided and abetted her in the fraud?” fiercely\\r\\n\\n\\ndemanded Alexander, his temper impetuously breaking through all his\\r\\n\\n\\nefforts to maintain a proud composure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna disdained to reply to him. Not one syllable would she condescend to\\r\\n\\n\\naddress to Alexander Lyon. But turning again to her grandfather she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid——\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Drusilla did not do so; she will never attempt to force herself upon\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Lyon. The young wife came, as I said, to save him from committing a\\r\\n\\n\\nfelony, and me from taking a fatal step; and not to force herself upon\\r\\n\\n\\nan unwilling husband. It will be well for him, when he shall come to\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself, if he can by any means, woo her back.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How happened it, then, my child?” inquired the General.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It was I, who for reasons that will be apparent, urged her to assume my\\r\\n\\n\\ndress and take my place in the wedding ceremony, and thus win back the\\r\\n\\n\\nsacred rights of which she had been so basely cheated!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But—still—how was this to be done in such a way, my dear?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“By rectifying in this second marriage the informality that rendered the\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst one illegal.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I contend,” burst forth Alexander, “that this second marriage is no\\r\\n\\n\\nmore legal than the first one was; _less_ so, if anything! for this is\\r\\n\\n\\nan imposture, a substitution of one person for another, besides being\\r\\n\\n\\nquite as irregular as the first marriage in the same particular of\\r\\n\\n\\nlacking a license!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He mistakes, my dear grandfather, there was a license,” said Anna,\\r\\n\\n\\nquietly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; a license authorizing the marriage of Alexander and Anna Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\nSuch was the document placed in the hands of the minister!” angrily\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed Alick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I _beg_ his pardon,” said Anna, still looking at, still speaking to her\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandfather. “The license of which _he_ speaks I burned with my own\\r\\n\\n\\nhands this evening. The license of which _I_ speak duly authorizes the\\r\\n\\n\\nnuptial rites to be solemnized between Alexander Lyon and Anna Drusilla\\r\\n\\n\\nSterling, and it is now in the possession of the minister.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It was then taken out by somebody else in my name. It can be of no sort\\r\\n\\n\\nof legal effect,” cried Mr. Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Again I entreat his forgiveness; but this one was procured by Alexander\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon himself, dear grandpa.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is FALSE!—I mean it is a mistake, Anna!” exclaimed Alexander,\\r\\n\\n\\ncorrecting himself. “I procured no such paper.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I fancy that he has forgotten the circumstance, dear sir; but I will\\r\\n\\n\\nrefresh his memory!” replied Anna. Then turning to the sorely\\r\\n\\n\\nembarrassed minister who had stood all this time an unwilling witness to\\r\\n\\n\\nthis painful scene, she added: “Dr. Barbar, will you have the goodness\\r\\n\\n\\nto return the envelope handed you by Mr. Hammond?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe good clergyman complied. Anna opened the envelope, and took from it\\r\\n\\n\\nits enclosure, which she handed to General Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe old gentleman put on his spectacles to examine it. Having silently\\r\\n\\n\\nread it, he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Why, this is—this is exactly what you represent it to be, my dear Anna!\\r\\n\\n\\nBut it bears date—Heaven bless my soul, of last January!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander started and turned ghastly pale, reeled, and recovered himself\\r\\n\\n\\nby a great effort.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How is this, my Anna? What does it all mean, my dear?” inquired the old\\r\\n\\n\\nsoldier.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander, putting a strong constraint upon himself, bent forward to\\r\\n\\n\\nhear the answer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It means this, my dear sir: You heard Mr. Lyon say that at the time of\\r\\n\\n\\nhis first marriage with this fair child he supposed the union to be\\r\\n\\n\\nperfectly legal; but that afterwards he chanced to discover that through\\r\\n\\n\\n‘the accidental omission of an important form,’ that ceremony to have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen quite invalid.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes! yes!” said General Lyon, impatiently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“He had some reason for what he said. Listen, dear sir: When this man\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst prevailed over this poor child to intrust herself to his care, he\\r\\n\\n\\nseems to have meant honestly by her. He procured this license for their\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage; and he took her before a regularly ordained minister of the\\r\\n\\n\\nchurch. But by some strange oversight he never handed the license to the\\r\\n\\n\\nminister, who, being a Northern man and a new comer into Virginia, and\\r\\n\\n\\nignorant of the law of the State which required a license to be shown\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore a marriage ceremony could be legally solemnized, never asked to\\r\\n\\n\\nsee the document, but married them, as he would have done in his own\\r\\n\\n\\nState, without it. Months later Mr. Lyon discovered this oversight, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhaving tired of his fair bride, he resolved to profit by it in freeing\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself from his obligations to her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And so this is the license he took out for his first marriage, but\\r\\n\\n\\nnever used?” inquired General Lyon, who for the last few moments had\\r\\n\\n\\nmaintained a wonderful composure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But how came it into your possession?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, the poor child found it among her husband’s papers, and cherished\\r\\n\\n\\nit with a fond superstition, as she cherished her wedding-ring. When she\\r\\n\\n\\ncame to me with her piteous story she put that piece of paper into my\\r\\n\\n\\nhands as a proof that she was no impostor. I saw at once how it might be\\r\\n\\n\\nused to get her rights, especially as her first Christian name, like\\r\\n\\n\\nmine, is Anna. So I burned my own license and substituted hers and\\r\\n\\n\\nclosed the envelope, which you, dear sir, unconscious of its contents,\\r\\n\\n\\ndelivered into Dick’s charge to be handed to the minister. Then, using\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch arguments as I thought must prevail over a wife and a Christian, I\\r\\n\\n\\npersuaded Drusilla to take my place, as I said. And now I am happy to\\r\\n\\n\\nannounce that through my means, and mine only, the omission of that\\r\\n\\n\\nimportant form in Drusilla’s first marriage ceremony has been supplied\\r\\n\\n\\nin the second, and that she is now unquestionably the lawful wife of\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander Lyon.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDrusilla lifted her head from Anna’s supporting bosom, and looked at her\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband where he stood, enraged, baffled and covered with confusion.\\r\\n\\n\\nThen she left Anna’s sheltering arms and went towards him, and with\\r\\n\\n\\noutstretched hands, face pale as death, and beseeching eyes, she\\r\\n\\n\\npleaded:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Alick! Alick love! it was not for myself! it was not for myself I\\r\\n\\n\\ndid this! Oh Alick! try to pardon me, dear! and I will pray to die and\\r\\n\\n\\nset you free!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd as if no one had been present but themselves, she sank at his feet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“BEGONE!” cried Alexander, furiously stamping, and turning away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir! you have disgraced yourself and the name you bear!” sternly\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed General Lyon, stooping and raising the poor little fallen\\r\\n\\n\\nfigure, and supporting it on his arm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Alexander was absolutely beside himself with fury. Forgetting that\\r\\n\\n\\nhe stood in the presence of old age and young womanhood, forgetting that\\r\\n\\n\\nhe was a man and a gentleman, he strode towards his heart-broken wife,\\r\\n\\n\\nand with livid face, starting eyes and brandishing hand, he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How dared you do this thing? How dared you bring me to this open shame?\\r\\n\\n\\nHow dared you brave me thus? How dared you, I demand?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe did not speak; but with clasped hands and uplifted eyes, seemed to\\r\\n\\n\\nimplore his forbearance.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You have repaid years of kindness by the blackest ingratitude; you have\\r\\n\\n\\ndeceived me by the most infamous treachery; you have sought your object\\r\\n\\n\\nby the basest fraud; you have ventured to take the place of the lady I\\r\\n\\n\\nloved and wished to wed, and so, stolen my hand by the meanest trick! I\\r\\n\\n\\nasked you where you found the effrontery to do all this?” he demanded,\\r\\n\\n\\ngrinding his teeth with rage and shaking his hand over her head.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStill she uttered no word in her defence; but still with appealing hands\\r\\n\\n\\nand eyes, mutely besought his mercy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick, who had been champing and stamping, and held in leash only by\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna, during this assault, now utterly broke bounds, and cried out:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Come come, Lyon! I’m blest if I’ll stand by and see a lady brow-beaten\\r\\n\\n\\nso, if it is by her husband! If you don’t stop this instantly, I’ll——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Be quiet, Richard Hammond, and let the man speak to his wife,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon authoritatively, with covert irony, as he laid his hand on\\r\\n\\n\\nDick and held him back.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nRichard yielded, seeing in this unnatural forbearance of the old\\r\\n\\n\\nsoldier, only the ominous calm that portends the fiercest storm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut, as for Alexander Lyon, so absorbed was he by his own raging\\r\\n\\n\\npassions, that he perceived nothing of this bye-scene. Still brandishing\\r\\n\\n\\nhis hand above her drooping head, he continued to pour out his wrath\\r\\n\\n\\nupon his wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You never loved me! You never loved any one but yourself! You never\\r\\n\\n\\nloved me, certainly, or you never would have betrayed me in this base\\r\\n\\n\\nmanner,” he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer white lips quivered—parted, but only inarticulate murmurs issued\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But do not flatter yourself, girl, that your treachery shall serve your\\r\\n\\n\\npurpose. Such a marriage, so procured, can never stand in law. And here,\\r\\n\\n\\nin the presence of these witnesses, I utterly refuse to acknowledge its\\r\\n\\n\\nvalidity, or to recognize you as my wife! Here, I renounce you forever!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer pleading hands were lifted in an agony of deprecation, and then\\r\\n\\n\\ndropped by her side, in despair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Had you accepted the position I gave you, although I should never have\\r\\n\\n\\nseen your face again, yet I would have provided handsomely for your\\r\\n\\n\\nsupport. But now, since you have put this foul deception upon me, for\\r\\n\\n\\nall the help you can get from me, you may—PERISH!” he hissed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not so,” said the fine old gentleman, General Lyon, drawing the arm of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe outraged and half crushed young creature, closer within his own.\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not so, by your leave. I charge myself with the care of _my niece_,\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Alexander Lyon. Her home shall be _here_, with my grand-daughter\\r\\n\\n\\nand myself—_here_, where she shall live in peace and safety—loved and\\r\\n\\n\\nhonored, until such times as you—madman!—shall come to your senses, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsue more humbly for the forgiveness of the wronged wife, than you ever\\r\\n\\n\\ndid for the love of the unhappy maiden.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You had better be quite sure that the girl in your arm _is_ a wife\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore you offer her the protection of your roof and the society of your\\r\\n\\n\\ngrand-daughter!” sneered Alexander, bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Sir, you have struck the last blow to your own honor and my patience.\\r\\n\\n\\nAlexander Lyon, if you were not the son of my dead brother I would curse\\r\\n\\n\\nyou where you stand! But go!” said the old man, lifting, up and\\r\\n\\n\\nstretching out his arm with an imperious gesture. “Leave this house, and\\r\\n\\n\\nnever desecrate its halls again with your presence! and never again let\\r\\n\\n\\nme see your face!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCursing and stamping with fury, Alexander turned and flung himself from\\r\\n\\n\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn the hall outside his voice was heard calling loudly to his servant to\\r\\n\\n\\nput his horses to his carriage and bring it around to the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon gazed down upon the poor young wife at his side, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Look up my child. Here is your home and your father and your sister. Be\\r\\n\\n\\nof good comfort, trust in God, and all will be well.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe answered nothing, but sunk heavily within his aged arms, that yet\\r\\n\\n\\nwere quite strong enough to support her sinking form. She had succumbed\\r\\n\\n\\nto one of those fainting fits which, through the agonies she had so long\\r\\n\\n\\nendured, had now become habitual to her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Grandpa, she has swooned! Marcy, come here quickly. You are strong;\\r\\n\\n\\nhelp to carry her to the sofa. Matty, go to the spare room opposite mine\\r\\n\\n\\nand turn down the bed; see to the fire, and come back and tell me when\\r\\n\\n\\nall is ready,” exclaimed Anna, rapidly issuing her orders, while she\\r\\n\\n\\nhastily took off Drusilla’s bridal wreath and veil, and unloosened her\\r\\n\\n\\ndress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMarcy who had been in the group of servants assembled to witness the\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage ceremony, was quickly on the spot, and with her assistance Anna\\r\\n\\n\\nbore the insensible form of Drusilla to the sofa and laid her on it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon followed, looking anxiously upon the pale face of the\\r\\n\\n\\nsufferer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDr. Barbar and Mr. Hammond were left standing on the rug, and for the\\r\\n\\n\\ntime being, forgotten by their host and hostess.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAll available means were used to revive the swooning girl, but all in\\r\\n\\n\\nvain. Anna bathed her face with eau de cologne, and applied strong\\r\\n\\n\\nsmelling salts to her nose; and Marcy smartly slapped her hands, but\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout effect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile they were thus engaged Matty entered the drawing-room, and\\r\\n\\n\\nannounced that the bed-chamber was ready.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“We must take her there and undress her and put her to bed, Mercy; and\\r\\n\\n\\nthen we shall have a better opportunity of applying restoratives,” said\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Miss, for it’s little we can do here,” admitted Marcy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dear grandpa,” said Anna, addressing the old gentleman, who still stood\\r\\n\\n\\nwatching with interest the face of the patient, “dear grandpa, you have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen so worried this evening. Do sit down and rest and order some\\r\\n\\n\\nrefreshment for yourself and for Dr. Barbar and Dick, who are being\\r\\n\\n\\nneglected. I shall take Drusilla to the Rose Room and see that every\\r\\n\\n\\nproper attention is given her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But she seems to be dead or dying,” said General Lyon, uneasily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, dear sir; she is only in a swoon, which is very natural under all\\r\\n\\n\\nthe circumstances; but not at all dangerous.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope you are certain of this?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Quite certain, sir. Now, Marcy, help me to lift her,” said Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Dick Hammond, who heard and saw all that was going on, hastened\\r\\n\\n\\nforward to offer his services as bearer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Anna, do let me carry her up stairs. I can do so with so much more ease\\r\\n\\n\\nto her than you and Marcy could,” he said. And without waiting for\\r\\n\\n\\nleave, he tenderly raised the unconscious form and gently bore it after\\r\\n\\n\\nMarcy, who led the way up to the Rose Room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna bade good night to Dr. Barbar, and then turned and kissed her\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandfather and asked for his usual blessing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“God bless you, my dear child, for you have done a righteous deed this\\r\\n\\n\\nnight. Take care of the poor desolate girl upstairs, and if I can be of\\r\\n\\n\\nany service to her, do not hesitate to call on me, even if you should\\r\\n\\n\\nhave to wake me up in the night. My house, my purse, and myself, Anna,\\r\\n\\n\\nare at her orders no less than at yours, as long as she has wants and I\\r\\n\\n\\nhave means,” answered the grand old man, as he pressed a kiss upon his\\r\\n\\n\\nchild’s brow and dismissed her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna hurried up stairs and met Dick on the landing. He had just\\r\\n\\n\\ndeposited his charge on her couch and left her room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hallelujah, Dick!” exclaimed Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Hallelujah, Anna!” responded Dick, as their hands met in a hearty,\\r\\n\\n\\ncongratulatory clasp.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It is all right with us now, Anna?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“All quite right now, Dick, darling.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick looked gratefully and then pleadingly in her face, as he took her\\r\\n\\n\\nhand again and gently drew her towards him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she laughingly broke away, exclaiming:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Not now, Dick; not now, darling. I must go to my patient. We must not\\r\\n\\n\\nneglect that poor girl, to whom we owe all our happiness.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed we must not,” earnestly agreed Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then good night, Dick. I will see you in the morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Good night, my liege lady. But stay. If I can be of any use, pray\\r\\n\\n\\ncommand me at any hour of the day or night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“That I will, Dick. Once more good night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Anna flitted past him and went into the Rose Room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere she found that Marcy and Matty had already divested Drusilla of\\r\\n\\n\\nher bridal robes and clothed her in a loose white wrapper and put her\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfortably to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey now stood one on each side rubbing her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“How is she?” inquired Anna, approaching and bending over the pallid\\r\\n\\n\\nface.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No change yet, Miss; but we must be patient and keep up this friction,\\r\\n\\n\\nand she will come to presently,” answered Marcy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna went into her own chamber and quickly changed her splendid dress\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a wadded white merino wrapper, and then returned to the sick\\r\\n\\n\\nchamber, and took her place beside the bed, saying;\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Matty, you may retire to rest. Marcy and myself will remain here\\r\\n\\n\\nto-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMatty who was yawning fearfully, gladly availed herself of the\\r\\n\\n\\npermission and left the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Miss Lyon willingly, gratefully, undertook the long night’s watch\\r\\n\\n\\nover the suffering young creature to whose almost incredible energy and\\r\\n\\n\\nheroism she owed her own preservation from a fatal marriage and her\\r\\n\\n\\nhopes of happiness with the man she loved.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                            CHAPTER XLVIII.\\r\\n\\n\\n                      BALM FOR THE BRUISED HEART.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n   Nay, but Nature brings her solace, for a tender voice will cry,—\\r\\n\\n\\n   ’Tis a purer life than his, a lip to drain her trouble dry.\\r\\n\\n\\n   Baby lips will laugh it down, his only rival bring her rest,\\r\\n\\n\\n   Baby fingers, waxen touches, press it from the mother’s breast.\\r\\n\\n\\n                                                           —TENNYSON.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe great old-fashioned hall clock was striking the quarter before\\r\\n\\n\\ntwelve when Richard Hammond re-entered the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe found General Lyon and Dr. Barbar still there, seated in large\\r\\n\\n\\narm-chairs each side of the fire-place. They seemed to be discussing the\\r\\n\\n\\nevents of the evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, old friend, my dog of a nephew, like that other grand rascal of\\r\\n\\n\\nold, has ‘spoiled the feast, broke the good meeting, with, most admired\\r\\n\\n\\ndisorder,’” sighed the general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah, my dear sir, he is young, and we must be charitable. Even David,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe man after the Lord’s own heart, had to pray that the sins of his\\r\\n\\n\\nyouth might not be remembered against him. Give the young man time to\\r\\n\\n\\nrecollect himself and to reform. But I feel very sorry for the poor\\r\\n\\n\\nwife—she seems but a mere child.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She is but sixteen or seventeen,” said General Lyon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ah dear, how sad! She seems to love him much.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“She loves a villain then, and must suffer accordingly.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Will he never be reconciled to her, do you think?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can she ever be reconciled to _him_? That is the question. ‘My spirit\\r\\n\\n\\nshall not always strive with man,’ saith the Lord. And if the Divine\\r\\n\\n\\nSpirit wearies of the fruitless struggle with Evil, how much sooner\\r\\n\\n\\nshall the human spirit sink? For myself, I should not wonder if she\\r\\n\\n\\nshould experience such a revulsion of feeling as should make the very\\r\\n\\n\\nthought of that man hateful to her. But in any case her home is here,\\r\\n\\n\\nunder our protection, until such time as he shall repent and show\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself worthy to reclaim her hand, if that time ever should come. Ah!\\r\\n\\n\\nhere is Dick. How did you leave our young charge, my boy?” inquired the\\r\\n\\n\\ngeneral, for the first time conscious of Richard’s presence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I left her in good hands, sir; otherwise much as she was when taken\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom this room. I understand, sir, that since her domestic sufferings\\r\\n\\n\\ncommenced she has been very subject to these fainting fits. They are\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid to be not dangerous; but for my part, I should think there was\\r\\n\\n\\nreason to fear that her heart is affected,” answered Richard, seeking a\\r\\n\\n\\nseat between the two old gentlemen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Dick, you were more engaged in this exposure of Alexander than Anna was\\r\\n\\n\\nwilling to admit. You knew of his previous marriage before you came down\\r\\n\\n\\nhere?” inquired the general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir; but only a few days before; and I came down here for the\\r\\n\\n\\nexpress purpose of divulging it to you; and I brought with me the\\r\\n\\n\\nminister who performed the first ceremony, as proof of it. But before I\\r\\n\\n\\nsaw you I chanced to meet Anna, who proposed to me another plan, which I\\r\\n\\n\\nthought to be a better one than my own.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Anna’s plan was assuredly the only one by which the ends of\\r\\n\\n\\njustice could be reached in this singular case.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Shall I tell you, sir, how I came to be informed of the first\\r\\n\\n\\nmarriage?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh no, Dick, not to-night—to-morrow. Gentlemen, it is on the stroke of\\r\\n\\n\\nmidnight. And though my sorry nephew has ‘spoiled the feast,’ et cetera,\\r\\n\\n\\nI see no reason why we should watch and fast the night through. We will\\r\\n\\n\\nhave supper and then to bed. And although you are the only wedding\\r\\n\\n\\nguests, we will adjourn to the banqueting room,” said General Lyon,\\r\\n\\n\\narising and leading the way to a brilliantly lighted and elegantly\\r\\n\\n\\ndecorated saloon, where a sumptuous supper was laid out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe host led his two guests to the upper end of the table, and invited\\r\\n\\n\\nthem to be seated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe two Jacobs, father and son, stood ready to wait on them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut what took away their appetites—whether it was the excitement of the\\r\\n\\n\\nevening, or the dreariness of a rich repast laid for many, and honored\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the presence of but three; or the embarrassing variety of\\r\\n\\n\\ndelicacies spread before them, is uncertain; but they could not eat. A\\r\\n\\n\\nbroken biscuit and a glass of wine, was all that each took. And then,\\r\\n\\n\\nwith mutual good nights and good wishes, they separated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon went to rest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOld Jacob showed Dr. Barbar to the best vacant bedroom, and young Jacob\\r\\n\\n\\nled Dick Hammond to the second best.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt is to be hoped that the two old gentlemen slept well.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick did not close his eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe revulsion from despair to hope, to certainty of happiness, was\\r\\n\\n\\nalmost too much for him. He lay rolling and tossing from side to side\\r\\n\\n\\nall night; telling himself over and over again that it was no dream;\\r\\n\\n\\nthat Anna was free; and that he might at last be made happy with her\\r\\n\\n\\nhand; and wondering how long it would be before he could coax Anna to\\r\\n\\n\\nname the happy day, and his uncle to give them his blessing. He heard\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old hall clock strike every hour, and thought the night would never\\r\\n\\n\\ncome to an end.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt four o’clock on that winter morning, it was still very dark, when he\\r\\n\\n\\nheard rousing raps at his door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well! who’s there?” he cried.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“It’s me, Master Dick,” answered the voice of Marcy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Well! what do you want?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please sir, Miss Anna——”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick was out of bed in an instant, drawing on his pantaloons.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n—“Says how young Mrs. Lyon is seemingly ill, and will you please to wake\\r\\n\\n\\nup the coachman, and tell him to take the fastest horse and ride quick\\r\\n\\n\\nas possible to Saulsburg for Dr. Leech.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick was dressed and at the door by the time Marcy had done speaking.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Can I see Miss Anna for an instant?” he inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I will ask her,” answered Marcy, hurrying down the passage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick hastened after her, and waited outside Drusilla’s door while Marcy\\r\\n\\n\\nwent in to inquire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna came out with a large shawl wrapped around her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, hurry, Dick! don’t stop to talk! the poor child is very ill, and\\r\\n\\n\\ndelay may be her death!” exclaimed Anna, as she appeared.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I merely stopped to tell you, Anna, that I shall trust to no servant,\\r\\n\\n\\nleast of all to slow old Jacob! I shall saddle my own fast horse, and\\r\\n\\n\\nfly for the doctor myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You’re a trump, Dick. Heaven bless you, be off?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Anna disappeared within the sick chamber. And Dick ran down to the\\r\\n\\n\\nstable, saddled his horse, leaped upon his back, struck spurs to his\\r\\n\\n\\nflanks and was off like an arrow in the direction of Saulsburg. “He\\r\\n\\n\\nskelpit on through dub and mire,” so eager in his errand, that he\\r\\n\\n\\nscarcely noticed the storm was over, and the clouds were breaking\\r\\n\\n\\noverhead; a few pale stars were shining out, and day was faintly dawning\\r\\n\\n\\nin the East.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen he came to the toll-gate, as once before, he cleared the bar with a\\r\\n\\n\\nbound, and dashed onward, to the infinite indignation of old Andy who\\r\\n\\n\\nhad just opened his shutters in time to witness the feat, and who turned\\r\\n\\n\\nto his old wife, then busy over the fire cooking the breakfast, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nexclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh, Jenny, woman! the warlocks are flitting back frae the witches’\\r\\n\\n\\nSabbath. There gaed are noo!—on a broomstick, or something unco like it,\\r\\n\\n\\nright over the toll-gate bar and awa’! We’ll hear the news the day,\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHeedless of what the guardian of the road might think of him, Dick raced\\r\\n\\n\\non, sending flakes of mud from his horse’s heels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe sun was rising behind the farthest range of mountains, and sending\\r\\n\\n\\nhis dazzling beams obliquely through the Wild Gap and athwart the Wild\\r\\n\\n\\nRiver, as Dick rode into Saulsburg and drew rein before the picturesque\\r\\n\\n\\ninn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe had not the slightest idea whereabouts in the village or its\\r\\n\\n\\nneighborhood the country doctor lived.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo he inquired of the hostler who came to take his horse:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Do you know where Dr. Leech hangs out?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I dunno where he hangs out, sir; but you can ax him hisself. He lives\\r\\n\\n\\nright down the street there, sir,” answered the man, pointing to a\\r\\n\\n\\nsmall, neat cottage, with a still smaller surgery beside it, and the\\r\\n\\n\\nname of “LEECH” over the door.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick left his horse and went and knocked up the doctor, and, in a few\\r\\n\\n\\nurgent words, told him his services were instantly needed at Old Lyon\\r\\n\\n\\nHall, where there was a lady in extremity, and entreated him to hasten\\r\\n\\n\\nimmediately to her relief.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe good doctor needed no second bidding, but loudly called to shop-boy\\r\\n\\n\\nand horse-boy to have his saddle-bags and his horse got ready, and then\\r\\n\\n\\nrushed into the house to put on his great-coat and hat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen Dick had seen the doctor fairly started on his journey, he turned\\r\\n\\n\\nhis steps to the little inn, entered it, and ordered breakfast.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And have my horse well rubbed down and watered and fed. I must mount\\r\\n\\n\\nhim again in an hour,” he added.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt this time of the day there always happened to be more servants than\\r\\n\\n\\nguests at the “Foaming Tankard,” and so Dick and his horse were both\\r\\n\\n\\npromptly served.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut while Mr. Hammond sat enjoying the fragrant coffee, light rolls,\\r\\n\\n\\nsweet butter, luscious ham and fresh eggs that formed the repast, for\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich his early ride had given him so keen an appetite, he was suddenly\\r\\n\\n\\ninterrupted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was “mammy” who burst in upon his privacy with more haste than\\r\\n\\n\\nceremony, demanding:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir, wasn’t you the gentleman as come down with us in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe night coach from Drainsville and got off at Frostville?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes! and wasn’t you the lady that scalped me and broke both my legs?”\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I hope you surwived it, sir? But that wasn’t what I comed to ax you.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes; having a good constitution, I got over it. But what _did_ you come\\r\\n\\n\\nto ask me?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Please, sir, no offence; but is it as the boys say, you come from Old\\r\\n\\n\\nLyon Hall this morning?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Arter a doctor?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“For a lady in ’streme ’stress?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Young Mrs. Lyon, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, sir, that was my own lady; and I jest knowed how it would be! I\\r\\n\\n\\njest did! Sir, she left here in an old ramshackly concern as broke down\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her afore she so much as got a mile from the place; and then she up\\r\\n\\n\\nand set out to walk all the way through the storm to the hall; and which\\r\\n\\n\\nif I’d a knowed, I’d a seen the old hall and everybody into it farther\\r\\n\\n\\nafore I’d a let her a risted of her life by so doing. But that there\\r\\n\\n\\nblamed boy,—Lord forgive me for swearing,—arter he’d upset her in the\\r\\n\\n\\nroad, took all the rest of the evening to haul off the old wreck of a\\r\\n\\n\\ncarriage, and never got back here till I had gone to bed. So I never\\r\\n\\n\\nknowed nothing about it till this morning, which a purty state my nerves\\r\\n\\n\\nhas been in ever since.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd mammy, having talked herself out of breath, dropped down in a chair\\r\\n\\n\\nand panted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You were this lady’s nurse?” inquired Dick, buttering a roll.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“In course I was, sir; perfessionally so; and recommended by the highest\\r\\n\\n\\ngentlemen of the physical persuasion.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Then, my good woman, I wonder why your patient didn’t take you along\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So do I, sir. That was a very sensible remark of yours; but you see,\\r\\n\\n\\nsir, she preferred to leave me here in care of the baggidge, which I\\r\\n\\n\\nwill say this—that mind can’t conceive, nor tongue tell the trouble I’ve\\r\\n\\n\\nhad to pertect them there two little red morocky trunks from being\\r\\n\\n\\nstoled or left behind!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Indeed?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“True as I tell you, sir; so I don’t much wonder at the madam wanting of\\r\\n\\n\\nme to stay behind to watch them.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No, nor I,” said Dick, slily. “But, my good woman,” he added, “I think\\r\\n\\n\\nnow that the best thing you can do is to go to your mistress.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Which such is my intention so to do sir; and I would be obliged to you\\r\\n\\n\\nif you would be so good as to speak to that there pig-headed\\r\\n\\n\\nlandlord—begging your pardon, sir, but so he is—to let me have a decent\\r\\n\\n\\nhorse and wagon, that won’t break down, to take me and the baggidge to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe old hall, which, if you are going back there, sir, yourself, you can\\r\\n\\n\\nshow me the way.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Dick, with good-natured alacrity, seeing at once how\\r\\n\\n\\nimportant it might be that Drusilla should have her nurse and her\\r\\n\\n\\nwardrobe. “Yes I will attend to it at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd he arose and rang the bell, and told the waiter who answered it to\\r\\n\\n\\nsend the landlord to him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe slow host came sauntering in with his hands in his pockets, and in\\r\\n\\n\\nanswer to Dick’s inquiries, deliberately acknowledged that he had “such\\r\\n\\n\\na thing,” and a bargain was soon struck for a wagon, horse and driver to\\r\\n\\n\\ntake mammy and her luggage to Old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But the bill is not yet paid,” said the landlord, hesitatingly, “and so\\r\\n\\n\\nI would rather keep a part of the luggage for security until it is\\r\\n\\n\\nsettled. One of the little trunks, now, might do.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Set you up with it, indeed!” fiercely exclaimed mammy, as much ruffled\\r\\n\\n\\nas a hen when her nest is threatened.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“But who’s to pay the bill?” pursued the host.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“I shall,” answered Dick, coldly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“No you won’t, sir, begging of your pardon; that wouldn’t be noways\\r\\n\\n\\nproper. The young madam left her port-munny long o’ me to settle all\\r\\n\\n\\nclaims. Bring your ’count in here to me, mister landlord, and I’ll\\r\\n\\n\\nsettle of it myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And not to lose time while he is making it out you had better go and\\r\\n\\n\\nget ready to start,” counselled Dick.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“So I had, sir; that’s another very sensible remark of yours. And I’ll\\r\\n\\n\\nnot keep you waiting one minute; I’ll be ready as soon as the wagon is,”\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid the old woman, hurrying out of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd in less than twenty minutes mammy reappeared ready for her journey.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe bill was paid, the wagon brought around and loaded with the luggage,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the nurse and the team started, escorted by Mr. Richard Hammond on\\r\\n\\n\\nhorseback, and cheered by all the ragamuffins in the village.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt does not take long after a storm is over for the water to run off the\\r\\n\\n\\nroads of that region, which are high roads in more senses than one; so\\r\\n\\n\\nthe travel was not so bad as might have been expected.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn little more than two hours the “procession” arrived at the toll-gate\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere old Andy was on duty.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh, sirs!” he exclaimed, on seeing Dick, “but ye’s a braw callant! Wha\\r\\n\\n\\ngave ye commission to loup twice over me bar, and cheat me of me toll?\\r\\n\\n\\nEh, but ye’ll bide where ye be till ye pay me for a’, e’en to the\\r\\n\\n\\nuttermost fearthing, before I let ye by; for ye’s no jump your wagon\\r\\n\\n\\nover the gate, I’m thinking.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Certainly, of course, all right. You see I was in too great a hurry to\\r\\n\\n\\nstop to make change, or to wait to have the gate opened when I passed\\r\\n\\n\\nhere last night and early this morning. But now open quickly to me. And\\r\\n\\n\\nhere! here is what will pay you for all the tolls and leave something\\r\\n\\n\\nbesides to buy a winter gown for the gudewife,” said Dick, laughing, and\\r\\n\\n\\ntossing a ten dollar gold coin to the old man. “And tell her this from\\r\\n\\n\\nme,” added the kind-hearted fellow, “that the girl she took so much\\r\\n\\n\\ninterest in is quite safe and well cared for.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Andy was not concerned about the safety of the girl, he was stooping\\r\\n\\n\\nto pick up the gold eagle, and muttering to himself:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Eh! how the lad flings about his gowd, to be sure! It’s weel a carefu’\\r\\n\\n\\nbody like mysel’ is nigh to gather it up. What was you saying anent the\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung hizzy, sir?” he inquired, looking up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Tell your good wife that she is safe and well cared for.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Ou, ay! it wad be i’ some house o’ correction; only there’s nae sic a\\r\\n\\n\\nuseful institootion in the country,” growled Andy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Never mind where she is, or who she is. Tell your wife she is all\\r\\n\\n\\nright!” said Dick, as he sauntered through the gate in advance of the\\r\\n\\n\\nwagon.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe worst part of the road was past, and so in something less than an\\r\\n\\n\\nhour the “cortege” arrived at Old Lyon Hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe doctor had been there already for some time, and he was then with\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung Mrs. Lyon, who seemed to all around her to be at the point of\\r\\n\\n\\ndeath.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSuch was the report of General Lyon, who immediately rang for a woman\\r\\n\\n\\nservant to show the nurse up to her patient.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“And I am very glad you thought to fetch her, Dick,” added the honest\\r\\n\\n\\nold general.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick explained that such thoughtfulness was no merit of his; that this\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman had attended the young wife down from Washington, and had been\\r\\n\\n\\nleft temporarily at Saulsburg, and had availed herself of his escort to\\r\\n\\n\\ncome on to the hall.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo mammy was taken up to her patient, whom she found much too ill to be\\r\\n\\n\\nscolded for her imprudence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn fact Drusilla was, as they said, almost at the point of death. Her\\r\\n\\n\\nlife hung upon the slenderest thread for five days, at the end of which\\r\\n\\n\\nshe became the mother of a beautiful boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs her illness before his birth had been severe and dangerous, so her\\r\\n\\n\\nconvalescence afterwards was slow and precarious. For many more days she\\r\\n\\n\\nlay in a mental and physical prostration, so profound that she was\\r\\n\\n\\nincapable of noticing her child, and even of realizing its existence.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut her youth and her good constitution were very much in her favor.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGradually, very gradually, she came out of this depressed state.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe first signs of reviving life she gave was the interest she showed in\\r\\n\\n\\nher babe.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBefore she had strength to speak above her breath, or sense to connect a\\r\\n\\n\\nsentence properly, she would mutely insist upon having him laid on her\\r\\n\\n\\narm and next her bosom; and then with a serene smile she would sink into\\r\\n\\n\\na tranquil sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd then, lest even the light weight of the infant should be too much\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her feeble strength, the nurse would steal the sleeping child from\\r\\n\\n\\nthe sleeping mother and lay him in the pretty berceaunette that had been\\r\\n\\n\\npurchased and decorated for him by Anna.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs the weeks went on, the young mother continued to revive; and her\\r\\n\\n\\ninterest in her infant boy became a passionate love, that grew with her\\r\\n\\n\\ngrowing strength.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhen she was able to be dressed and to recline in her easy chair, she\\r\\n\\n\\nwould sit hours with the babe clasped to her bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nStrangely enough, that female martinet, the monthly nurse, never\\r\\n\\n\\nobjected to this.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd to all Anna’s remonstrances Drusilla would answer:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Miss Lyon, you don’t know, you can’t know, what this soft little\\r\\n\\n\\nform is to me, as I hold it to my bosom. It is such a soothing balm—such\\r\\n\\n\\na heavenly comfort.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSometimes Anna would take an opportunity to speak to mammy on the\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject; but mammy would answer:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“You let her alone, Miss. It’s all natur’ and all right. The baby’ll\\r\\n\\n\\nsave her life. It’ll draw all the soreness out’n her heart and heal it\\r\\n\\n\\nup; mind me.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut suddenly the thought came to the young mother that she was perhaps\\r\\n\\n\\ninjuring her child by holding him in her lap so constantly. And then all\\r\\n\\n\\nher conduct with it changed. She would take him up only to nurse and get\\r\\n\\n\\nhim to sleep. And then she would lay him in his little decorated cradle;\\r\\n\\n\\nbut that cradle stood always by her side, so that, sleeping or waking,\\r\\n\\n\\nher infant son was never out of her sight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was beautiful to see the interest that the old General and his\\r\\n\\n\\ngrand-daughter took in this young mother and child.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGeneral Lyon visited Drusilla every morning, bringing some rare offering\\r\\n\\n\\nof fruit ordered from the city, or flowers from his own conservatory.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnna was seldom out of the chamber. Every forenoon she took her\\r\\n\\n\\nneedle-work and went to keep Drusilla company.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd often they might be seen sitting, working together, with the baby in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe cradle between them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDick, in his enthusiasm, said of this group, that it was “a sleeping\\r\\n\\n\\ncherub watched by two guardian angels.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n“Watched by guardian angels,” in her home of peace, we will also leave\\r\\n\\n\\nthe young, forsaken wife.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhether Drusilla ever was re-united with her husband, or whether Dick\\r\\n\\n\\nwas ever really reclaimed from the clutches of his “friends,” and\\r\\n\\n\\nrewarded with the hand of Anna, will be duly related in the sequel to\\r\\n\\n\\nthis book, which will immediately appear, under the title of “THE\\r\\n\\n\\nBRIDES’ FATE.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                                THE END.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                T.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\n\\n\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\n\\n\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\n\\n\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\n\\n\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s\\r\\n\\n\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\n\\n\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\n\\n\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\n\\n\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\n\\n\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\n\\n\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\n\\n\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\n\\n\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\n\\n\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n\\n\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\n\\n\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\n\\n\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\n\\n\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\n\\n\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\n\\n\\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\n\\n\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\n\\n\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website\\r\\n\\n\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\n\\n\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\n\\n\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\n\\n\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\n\\n\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\n\\n\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n\\n\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\n\\n\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\n\\n\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\n\\n\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\n\\n\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\n\\n\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\n\\n\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\n\\n\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\n\\n\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\n\\n\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\n\\n\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\n\\n\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\n\\n\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\n\\n\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\n\\n\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\n\\n\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\n\\n\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\n\\n\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\n\\n\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\n\\n\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\n\\n\\nedition.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\n\\n\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\n\\n\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\n\\n\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\n\\n\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69972/pg69972.txt'})]\n"
