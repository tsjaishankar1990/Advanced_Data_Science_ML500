This can be done through differentiated instruction, project-based learning, or other approaches that allow students to take ownership of their own learning and pursue their own interests.\n",

Real education sparks an inner passion for learning and curiosity about the world. It fuels a lifelong love of discovery and seeking truth. The fire lit by a skillful teacher will continue to burn brightly for years to come, as the student explores new subjects and pursues new interests on their own. An educator ignites minds and opens them to new possibilities and potentials. The fire of learning engenders more learning, as well as the light by which to better understand oneself and life."
