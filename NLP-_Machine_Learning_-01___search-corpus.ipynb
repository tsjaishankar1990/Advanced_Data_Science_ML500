He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs, respectively.[5] He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[6] Tendulkar was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by nomination from 2012 to 2018.[7][8]\n",

In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.\n",

    "He has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as the ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and has won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year. Additionally, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Khel Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.\n",

    "In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN, and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2020, he was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of over $26 million. Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable cricketers, with estimated earnings of ₹165 crore (US$21 million) in the year 2022.\n",

    "is unintentional overlap with downstream evals. This is\n",
    "important to investigate since, in a worst-case scenario, a\n",
    "complete copy of an evaluation dataset could leak into the\n",
    "pre-training dataset and invalidate the evaluation as a mean-\n",
    "ingful test of generalization. One option to prevent this is to\n",
    "identify and remove all duplicates before training a model.\n",
    "While this guarantees reporting true hold-out performance,\n",
    "it requires knowing all possible data which a model might\n",
    "be evaluated on ahead of time. This has the downside of\n",
    "limiting the scope of benchmarking and analysis. Adding a\n",
    "new evaluation would require an expensive re-train or risk\n",
    "reporting an un-quantified benefit due to overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we document how much overlap occurs and how\n",
    "performance changes due to these overlaps. To do this, we\n",
    "use the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) For each evaluation dataset, we run a duplicate detector\n",
    "(see Appendix C) on its examples. We then manually inspect\n",
    "the found nearest neighbors and set a per dataset threshold\n",
    "to keep high precision while maximizing recall. Using\n",
    "this threshold, we then create two new subsets, Overlap,\n",
    "which contains all examples which have a similarity to a\n",

    "Another potential confounder of our analysis is that the un-\n",
    "derlying data distribution may shift between the Overlap\n",
    "and Clean subsets. For example, on Kinetics-700 many\n",
    "“overlaps” are in fact all black transition frames. This ex-\n",
    "plains why Kinetics-700 has an apparent 20% accuracy drop\n",
    "on Overlap. We suspect more subtle distribution shifts\n",
    "likely exist. One possibility we noticed on CIFAR-100 is\n",
    "that, due to the very low resolution of its images, many\n",
    "duplicates were false positives of small objects such as birds\n",
    "or planes. Changes in accuracy could instead be due to\n",
    "changes in the class distribution or difficulty of the dupli-\n",

    "CLIP has a wide range of capabilities due to its ability to\n",
    "carry out arbitrary image classification tasks. One can give\n",
    "it images of cats and dogs and ask it to classify cats, or give\n",
    "it images taken in a department store and ask it to classify\n",

    "for which AI may be unfit. Like any image classification\n",
    "system, CLIP’s performance and fitness for purpose need to\n",
    "be evaluated, and its broader impacts analyzed in context.\n",
    "CLIP also introduces a capability that will magnify and alter\n",
    "such issues: CLIP makes it possible to easily create your\n",
    "own classes for categorization (to ‘roll your own classifier’)\n",
    "without a need for re-training. This capability introduces\n",
    "challenges similar to those found in characterizing other,\n",
    "large-scale generative models like GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\n",
    "2020); models that exhibit non-trivial zero-shot (or few-\n",
    "shot) generalization can have a vast range of capabilities,\n",
    "many of which are made clear only after testing for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our studies of CLIP in a zero-shot setting show that the\n",
    "model displays significant promise for widely-applicable\n",
    "tasks like image retrieval or search. For example, it can find\n",
    "relevant images in a database given text, or relevant text\n",
    "given an image. Further, the relative ease of steering CLIP\n",
    "toward bespoke applications with little or no additional data\n",
    "or training could unlock a variety of novel applications that\n",
    "are hard for us to envision today, as has occurred with large\n",
    "language models over the past few years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the more than 30 datasets studied in earlier\n",
    "sections of this paper, we evaluate CLIP’s performance on\n",
    "the FairFace benchmark and undertake exploratory bias\n",
    "probes. We then characterize the model’s performance in\n",
    "a downstream task, surveillance, and discuss its usefulness\n",
    "as compared with other available systems. Many of CLIP’s\n",
    "capabilities are omni-use in nature (e.g. OCR can be used\n",
    "to make scanned documents searchable, to power screen\n",
    "reading technologies, or to read license plates). Several\n",
    "of the capabilities measured, from action recognition, ob-\n",

    "for our second label set we used a combined set of labels that\n",
    "Google Cloud Vision, Amazon Rekognition and Microsoft\n",
    "Azure Computer Vision returned for all the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first simply looked into gender prediction performance\n",
    "of the model on the images of Members of Congress, in\n",
    "order to check to see if the model correctly recognized\n",
    "men as men and women as women given the image of a\n",
    "person who appeared to be in an official setting/position of\n",
    "power. We found that the model got 100% accuracy on the\n",
    "images. This is slightly better performance than the model’s\n",
    "performance on the FairFace dataset. We hypothesize that\n",
    "one of the reasons for this is that all the images in the\n",
    "Members of Congress dataset were high-quality and clear,\n",
    "with the people clearly centered, unlike those in the FairFace\n",
    "dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to study how the biases in returned labels depend on\n",
    "the thresholds set for label probability, we did an experiment\n",
    "in which we set threshold values at 0.5% and 4.0%. We\n",
    "found that the lower threshold led to lower quality of labels.\n",
    "However, even the differing distributions of labels under\n",
    "this threshold can hold signals for bias. For example, we\n",
    "find that under the 0.5% threshold labels such as ‘nanny’\n",
    "and ‘housekeeper’ start appearing for women whereas labels\n",
    "such as ‘prisoner’ and ‘mobster’ start appearing for men.\n",
    "This points to gendered associations similar to those that\n",
    "have previously been found for occupations (Schwemmer\n",
    "et al., 2020) (Nosek et al., 2002) (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the higher 4% threshold, the labels with the highest prob-\n",
    "ability across both genders include “lawmaker”, “legislator”\n",
    "and “congressman”. However, the presence of these biases\n",
    "amongst lower probability labels nonetheless point to larger\n",
    "questions about what ‘sufficiently’ safe behaviour may look\n",
    "\n",
    "like for deploying such systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When given the combined set of labels that Google Cloud\n",
    "Vision (GCV), Amazon Rekognition and Microsoft returned\n",
    "for all the images, similar to the biases Schwemmer et al.\n",
    "(2020) found in GCV systems, we found our system also\n",
    "disproportionately attached labels to do with hair and ap-\n",
    "pearance in general to women more than men. For ex-\n",
    "ample, labels such as ‘brown hair’, ‘blonde’ and ‘blond’\n",
    "appeared significantly more often for women. Additionally,\n",
    "CLIP attached some labels that described high status occu-\n",
    "pations disproportionately more often to men such as ‘ex-\n",
    "ecutive’ and ‘doctor’. Out of the only four occupations that\n",
    "it attached more often to women, three were ‘newscaster’,\n",
    "‘television presenter’ and ‘newsreader’ and the fourth was\n",
    "‘Judge’. This is again similar to the biases found in GCV\n",
    "and points to historical gendered differences (Schwemmer\n",
    "et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, when we lowered the threshold to 0.5% for\n",
    "this set of labels, we found that the labels disproportionately\n",
    "describing men also shifted to appearance oriented words\n",
    "such as ‘suit’, ‘tie’ and ‘necktie’ (Figure 18). Many occupa-\n",

    "\n",
